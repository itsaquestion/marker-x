## 1. **Introduction**



Designed primarily as a means of communication, computers and the internet have revolutionized the way we produce and exchange services and goods, whether they are digital or not. As a consequence, at the turn of the century a first wave of digital firms like Apple and Microsoft have paved their ways among the major companies in the world. Then, another wave has emerged in the last 15 years, with companies like Amazon, Alibaba, Facebook, 
   and

1. **引言**

本文旨在探讨计算机和互联网作为一种交流手段，如何彻底改变了我们生产和交换服务和商品（无论是数字还是非数字）的方式，并对此进行学术文献分析。结果表明，在世纪之交时期，像苹果和微软这样的第一波数字公司已经成为世界上主要公司之一。随后，在过去15年中出现了另一波浪潮，像亚马逊、阿里巴巴、Facebook等公司崭露头角。

Google, Airbnb, Baidu, Booking.com or Uber, also leaping into the front ranks of the world's corporate giants. 1 These companies rely on different business models but all aim at facilitating interactions between individuals and/or firms, and as such they belong to the same general category, now known as platforms. The objective of this article is to take some insights from the academic literature first to understand how platforms compete and second to discuss some elements of competition policy in the digital world. 

谷歌、Airbnb、百度、Booking.com或优步等公司也纷纷跻身世界企业巨头之列。尽管这些公司依赖不同的商业模式，但它们的共同目标是促进个人和/或企业之间的互动，因此它们都属于广义的平台类别。本文旨在借鉴学术文献中的一些观点，首先探讨平台竞争的方式，其次讨论数字世界中竞争政策的一些要素。

As a preamble, let us define more precisely what we mean by a platform. 2 For this consider the firms menare now the top-6 firms in terms of market capitalization, whereas in 
2007 Microsoft was the only tech firm in the top-10 and ranked 6th. 

首先，让我们更加精确地定义一下我们所指的平台。考虑到目前市值最高的六家公司，它们分别是谷歌、Airbnb、百度、Booking.com和优步。而在2007年，微软是唯一一家进入前十名并且排名第六的科技公司。

重写后的中文内容如上所示。

tioned above: Facebook is a social media website, Google a search engine, Amazon and Alibaba are marketplaces, whereas Uber matches drivers and riders. Despite these very different activities, all these firms have built their models to act as an intermediary. Platforms, just like classical intermediaries, act as matching devices, allowing each side of the market, or at least one side of the market, to find the best agent on the other side—that is, the one that generates the highest surplus. The fact that so much information is available on the internet facilitates this matching process. The emergence of matching platforms is part of the "dis-intermediation" process that has led to potential separation of information management from production/storage and delivery. Hence, some platforms are pure "infomediaries", focusing on information, acting as aggregators (like TripAdvisor) or sharing platforms (Airbnb). Others (like Amazon Marketplace) provide matching as well as support for transactions and delivery. But a common feature that distinguishes these platforms from traditional resellers is that they allow autonomy for agents on both sides of the market to meet and define trade (see Hagiu and Wright, 2014 ). 

如上所述：Facebook是一个社交媒体网站，Google是一个搜索引擎，亚马逊和阿里巴巴是市场平台，而Uber则匹配司机和乘客。尽管这些公司从事的活动各不相同，但它们都构建了自己的模型来充当中介。平台与传统的中介类似，充当匹配设备，使市场的每一方或至少市场的一方能够找到另一方最佳的主体——即产生最高剩余价值的主体。互联网上有大量信息可用，这有助于这个匹配过程。匹配平台的出现是“去中介化”过程的一部分，该过程导致了信息管理与生产/存储和交付之间潜在的分离。因此，一些平台是纯粹的“信息中介”，专注于信息，并充当聚合器（如TripAdvisor）或共享平台（Airbnb）。其他平台（如Amazon Marketplace）不仅提供匹配功能，还支持交易和交付。但与传统经销商不同之处在于，这些平台允许市场两边的主体自主相遇并定义贸易（参见Hagiu和Wright, 2014年）。

Consequently, potential users of a platform are often concerned about the size of the other side's population to which they will be matched. A seller is more likely to visit a platform if there are many potential buyers, and viceversa. These network effects explain why the market tends to favor large firms. Even if network effects existed before the emergence of digital firms, for example with telephone communication systems, they often operate differently in the case of platforms. Indeed, potential sellers value a platform more if there are more buyers, not if there are more sellers. So platforms are able to generate or take advantage of inter-group or multi-sided network effects (or indirect network effects) rather than intra-group or direct network effects. Through network effects, every agent, by subscribing to a platform, generates value for some other agents on the platform, which can be positive or negative. This generated value is a common feature of platforms and what are now called two-sided markets. 3 
Regarding pricing, some groups are important for the other sides, whereas other groups are less important—for example, users are essential for advertisers on a platform while users may care less about advertisers. If a platform can identify each user, and in particular the group to which each user belongs, then it can price the various groups differently. One im portant subject of study is how platforms set their prices on the different sides of the market, and we will see that the value of the externality is a key component of the optimal pricing formula. 4 The presence of network effects also increases the significance of the beliefs every agent holds about the future behavior of the other agents. Since the benefit every agent gains depends on the number of agents he can trade with, there is a potential coordination issue when it comes to choosing whether to join a platform or which platform to join. This means that the success or failure of a platform depends to a large extent on the beliefs consumers hold about its future success or failure. This belief dependency explains the additional uncertainty that exists about the fate of platforms, compared with firms in more standard markets. The problem is even more acute when a firm attempts to enter a market where there is already another firm. In contrast to standard markets where agents can be gained individually, it is necessary to attract groups of agents, triggering collective moves and achieving a critical mass. Success here depends on the ability to set smart prices but also to change consumers' beliefs about market dynamics. 

因此，平台的潜在用户通常关注与之匹配的另一方人口的规模。如果潜在买家众多，卖家更有可能访问平台，反之亦然。这些网络效应解释了为什么市场倾向于支持大型企业。尽管在数字化企业出现之前就存在网络效应，例如电话通信系统，但在平台的情况下，它们的运作方式通常不同。实际上，潜在卖家更看重平台上有更多买家而不是更多卖家。因此，平台能够产生或利用跨群体或多边网络效应（或间接网络效应），而不是内部群体或直接网络效应。通过网络效应，每个主体通过订阅一个平台为该平台上的其他一些主体创造价值，这个价值可以是正面的也可以是负面的。这种创造的价值是平台和现在所称为双边市场的共同特征。

关于定价问题，在某些情况下对于其他方来说某些群体非常重要, 而对于其他群体则不那么重要 - 例如，在一个平台上广告商对用户至关重要, 而用户可能对广告商并不那么关心. 如果一个平台能够识别每个用户，特别是每个用户所属的群体，那么它可以对不同的群体进行不同的定价。一个重要的研究课题是平台如何在市场的不同方面设定价格，我们将看到外部性价值是最优定价公式的关键组成部分。

网络效应的存在也增加了每个主体对其他主体未来行为持有的信念的重要性。由于每个主体获得的利益取决于他可以与之交易的主体数量，当选择是否加入一个平台或加入哪个平台时存在潜在协调问题。这意味着一个平台成功与否在很大程度上取决于消费者对其未来成功或失败持有的信念。这种信念依赖性解释了相比于更标准化市场中企业而言，关于平台命运存在额外不确定性。当企业试图进入已经有其他企业存在市场时，问题变得更加严峻。与可以逐个获取主体不同，在这里需要吸引一群主体，并引发集体行动并达到临界质量。成功取决于能够制定巧妙价格以及改变消费者对市场动态的信念能力。

The first part of this article aims at reviewing the major theories of platform competition, to understand whether and how effective competition can occur between platforms. There is growing debate about the possible breakup of many so-called "dominant platforms," in particular Amazon, Facebook and Google. So the issue of the economic sustainability of competition in those markets needs to be addressed. More precisely, we will discuss the features that make a market more likely to be monopolized. When the market in which platforms operate is likely to be a monopoly, we discuss the extent to which this market can be contested. Indeed, the fact that a market is a monopoly does not prevent contesting the position of the monopolist. While this discussion will concern markets with "tipping" on one platform, the lessons will also be insightful about the ability of new entrants to emerge in markets that can only accommodate a few firms. If the market under scrutiny is not a monopoly, it will be crucial to analyze in more details the different forms platform competition can take. The most common form to be analyzed is price competition, and we will discuss the likely competitive prices and their normative properties. We will see how price competition between platforms depends on the behavior of the agents, in particular on their decision to stick to one platform - i.e., to "single-home" - or to potentially visit more than one platform - i.e., to "multihome." A last, we will emphasize the role played by consumers' belief in shaping platform competition. 

本文的第一部分旨在回顾平台竞争的主要理论，以了解平台之间是否以及如何进行有效竞争。目前有关许多所谓“主导平台”（尤其是亚马逊、Facebook和谷歌）可能被拆分的问题引发了越来越多的争论，因此需要探讨这些市场上竞争的经济可持续性问题。更具体地说，我们将讨论使市场更有可能垄断化的特征。当平台所在市场有可能成为垄断时，我们将探讨这个市场可以被争夺到什么程度。实际上，一个市场是垄断并不意味着不能对垄断者地位进行挑战。虽然本文将重点讨论存在“倾斜”现象的市场，但其中得出的结论也对只能容纳少数几家公司进入的市场中新进入者能力具有洞察力。如果受审查的市场不是垄断，则需要详细分析平台竞争可以采取的不同形式。最常见要分析的形式是价格竞争，我们将讨论可能存在的竞争价格及其规范属性。我们将看到，在平台之间进行价格竞争取决于主体的行为，特别是他们决定坚持一个平台（即“单一归属”）还是可能访问多个平台（即“多归属”）。最后，我们将强调消费者信念在塑造平台竞争中所起的作用。

The second part of this article will focus on competition policy issues in two-sided markets. As competition is not solely based on prices, we will have to discuss some non-price dimensions related to the design of the service chosen by competing platforms. Markets where platforms are prevalent have been scrutinized by many competition agencies over the past 20 years and some conducts have been considered anti-competitive. However, the rules generally used to assess the competitive or anti-competitive nature of firms' policies have been designed for standard markets. We will therefore revisit competition policy issues in the context of two-sided markets where the competing firms are platforms. In particular, we will discuss the notion of market power, the essential definition of markets, and the consequences of practices such as tying, exclusionary pricing, exclusivity, foreclosure, collusion, and mergers. We will see that multi-sided externalities create new opportunities for anti-competitive conducts. These new conducts can often be related to some pricing or contractual imperfections, in particular zero-pricing and imperfect coordination between sides. 

本文的第二部分将聚焦于双边市场中的竞争政策问题。由于竞争并不仅仅基于价格，我们将讨论与竞争平台所选择的服务设计相关的非价格维度。在过去20年中，许多竞争机构对平台主导的市场进行了审查，并认定某些行为具有反竞争性质。然而，通常用于评估公司政策是否具有竞争性或反竞争性的规则是针对标准市场设计的。因此，在平台作为竞争企业存在于双边市场背景下，我们将重新审视竞争政策问题。特别是，我们将讨论市场力量概念、市场的基本定义以及捆绑销售、排除定价、独占权、封锁、勾结和合并等做法所带来的后果。我们将看到，多边外部性为反竞争行为创造了新机会。这些新行为通常与一些定价或合同上的缺陷有关，特别是零定价和各方之间不完全协调。

## 2. Theories Of Platform **Competition**



In the last 20 years, there has been an impressive body of research dealing with platform competition. The objective of this section is to take stock of this literature keeping in mind a few key questions. First, to which extent platform competition should lead to market monopolization? In line with the current debate in many countries regarding the break-up of tech giants, this question is central and clearly deserves to be looked at. Second, when platform competition leads to monopolization, is a form of competition for the market still possible? If it is the case, we can hope that a new and more efficient entrant would be able to replace the current incumbent. If not, then some form of policy intervention may be required. Third, when platform competition does not lead to monopolization, and therefore when there is competition within the market, what are the main features of this competition? Answering this question will allow us to understand when consumers can benefit from competition. We will conclude this first part by discussing the crucial role of beliefs and coordination in shaping competition outcomes. 

过去20年来，关于平台竞争的研究取得了令人瞩目的成果。本节旨在回顾这些文献，并思考几个关键问题。首先，平台竞争在多大程度上会导致市场垄断？与当前许多国家关于拆分科技巨头的辩论相一致，这个问题至关重要且值得深入探讨。其次，当平台竞争导致垄断时，是否仍然存在对市场的竞争？如果是这样，我们可以期望新的、更高效的参与者能够取代现有的主导者。如果不是这样，那么可能需要进行某种形式的政策干预。第三，在平台竞争不导致垄断、因此存在市场内部竞争时，这种竞争具有哪些主要特征？回答这个问题将使我们能够了解消费者何时可以从竞争中获益。最后，我们将讨论信念和协调在塑造竞争结果方面所起到的至关重要作用。

## 2.1. Does Platform Competition Lead To *Monopolization?*



2.1.1. Demand-driven network effects and *tipping* 
In many markets, economists tend to favor competition as the main regulator of economic activity with the caveat that this is not always feasible. In particular, there are some markets where only a few firms can reasonably survive while making a profit. This is usually the case when the cost structure favors big firms which produce a large quantity of the relevant good. When there is a large setup cost, or more generally when cost structure exhibits increasing returns to scale, the market is likely to support only a few firms. 

2.1.1. 需求驱动的网络效应和“倾斜”

在许多市场中，经济学家通常将竞争视为经济活动的主要调节者，尽管这并非总是可行的。特别是在一些市场上，只有少数几家公司能够合理地生存并获利。这通常发生在成本结构偏向于生产大量相关商品的大型企业的情况下。当存在较高的设立成本，或者更一般地说，当成本结构呈现规模报酬递增时，市场很可能只支持少数几家公司。

对于上述中文译文进行重写以提升流畅度，同时保持准确性和学术风格。

In digital markets, there are some increasing returns to scale as content, once created, is easily duplicated and distributed. But fixed costs are hardly as high as they may be in traditional network industries where monopolization emerges quite naturally. The most striking aspect of digital markets lies in the fact that the average net revenue per user increases with the total number of users because of the existence of demand-driven network effects. As the number of users goes up, the user's willingness to pay also goes up, as well as the price a firm can set for its service. And the competitive advantage of this firm over its rival is increased. 

在数字市场中，存在规模报酬递增的现象，因为一旦内容被创建，就可以轻松地复制和分发。然而，与传统网络行业相比，固定成本并不那么高，因此垄断现象相对较少。数字市场最引人注目的特点在于需求驱动的网络效应的存在，这导致每位用户的平均净收入随着用户总数的增加而增加。随着用户数量的增加，用户愿意支付的金额也会增加，公司可以设定更高的价格来提供服务。这将增强该公司相对于竞争对手的竞争优势。

Consider a hypothetical situation where two firms, A 
and B, act as platforms and compete to attract users. Assuming that connecting people is the only activity of the firms, and abstracting from price competition by assuming that the service is free, means that these two firms are ex-ante perfectly identical. Consider network effects at the firm level and that initially, firm A captures slightly more than half of the market, firm B capturing slightly less. If the switching costs between A and B are not too large, some of B's consumers will switch to A. This move will amplify the difference between the two firms and ultimately all agents will opt for firm A. In the presence of network effects, there is a tendency for markets to favor only one firm, which we refer to as tipping. 5 
Concentration is efficient because the larger the number of people in the same network, the larger the marginal value created by an additional user. Therefore, it is not so much the cost structure as the demand that can lead to monopolization. 2.1.2. Elements for competition within the *market* 
Still, monopoly is not the only possible outcome for platform competition. At least three elements can prevent a market exhibiting network effects from tipping: the existence of some form of differentiation among platforms, the possibility for users to multi-home, and the possibility for platforms to interoperate. 

假设存在两家公司A和B，它们作为平台竞争吸引用户。假设这两家公司的唯一活动是连接人们，并且假设服务是免费的，忽略价格竞争，这意味着这两家公司在事前完全相同。考虑到公司层面的网络效应，并且最初，公司A占据市场略多于一半，而公司B占据市场略少。如果A和B之间的切换成本不太高，B的一些消费者将转向A。这种转移将放大两家公司之间的差异，并最终所有参与者都会选择公司A。在存在网络效应的情况下，市场有倾向只支持一个公司，我们称之为“倾斜”。集中度是有效的，因为在同一个网络中人数越多，则每增加一个用户所创造的边际价值就越大。因此，并不仅仅是成本结构而是需求可能导致垄断化。
然而，在平台竞争中垄断并不是唯一可能结果。至少有三个因素可以防止具有网络效应的市场倾斜：平台之间存在某种形式的差异化、用户可以同时使用多个平台以及平台之间可以互操作性。

Platform *Differentiation.* Most platforms are not simply match-makers, even if the presence of cross-side externalities is a fundamental aspect of their business model. Quite often, platforms also provide services that attract users from one side independently of the actions chosen by the other side. An example are smartphones. Consumers may choose one device based on its quality, e.g. camera or ergonomics, even if fewer applications are available on the operating system (and therefore when the indirect network effects are smaller). Let us return to our example where two platforms compete. Even if most consumers were initially on one platform, some may be willing to switch to another platform because the quality of service offered by the smaller platform is good enough to compensate consumers for being on the platform with lower network benefits. If the service provided by the smaller platform is valuable for at least some consumers, then this platform may be able to survive even if it attracts fewer consumers. Note that this platform's differentiation can also be achieved by offering different types of services. Note also that in some cases, the simple fact that the network only attracts a specific subset of users (the young for Tik Tok, a video-sharing social networking service, or the runners and cyclists for Strava) can make this platform attractive for consumers. The more differentiated platforms are, at least in the eyes of consumers, the less network effects will matter for the competitive process, thereby enabling several platforms to survive in the market. 

平台差异化。大多数平台并非仅仅是撮合者，尽管跨侧外部性在其商业模式中是一个基本方面。通常情况下，平台还提供吸引用户的服务，这些用户可能独立于另一方所选择的行动而选择该平台。智能手机就是一个例子。消费者可能会根据其质量（如相机或人体工程学）选择一种设备，即使操作系统上可用的应用程序较少（因此间接网络效应较小）。让我们回到两个平台竞争的例子中。即使大多数消费者最初在一个平台上，一些消费者可能愿意转向另一个平台，因为较小平台提供的服务质量足够好以弥补消费者在网络效益较低的平台上所承受的代价。如果较小平台提供的服务对至少一些消费者有价值，则该平台可能能够生存下来，即使它吸引了更少的消费者。请注意，该平台差异化也可以通过提供不同类型的服务来实现。还要注意，在某些情况下，网络只吸引特定用户群体（例如Tik Tok面向年轻人、Strava面向跑步和骑行爱好者）这个简单事实可能使该平台对消费者具有吸引力。至少在消费者眼中，平台差异化越大，网络效应对竞争过程的影响就越小，从而使多个平台能够在市场上生存下来。

Multi-homing. The second element that can mitigate tipping is the possibility for consumers to multi-home, potentially subscribing to more than one platform. As long as there are two active platforms, and some agents choose to join only one, the other agents will have incentives to subscribe to both platforms (this is the case for advertisers in the media industry). Multi-homing allows agents to benefit from large network effects and potentially the services of the two platforms. By contrast, single-homing agents spare some cost but may fail to be connected to some users. Therefore, if some agents can multi-home, there may be scope for stable situations with multiple networks. The question of the sustainability of more than one platform will be driven by the cost structure and demand heterogeneity, in terms of valuation of services and network effects. 6 
Interoperability. When platforms decide, or are forced, to adopt some interoperability, having more than one platform may not lower social welfare as each user can be connected to all the other agents even if they join only one platform. 7 But it is far from clear that all platforms have incentives to accept this interoperability. Let us return to the case of two firms, A and B, assuming that firm A initially captures a larger share of the market than B. Each firm faces the same trade-off. By allowing interoperability, consumers are connected to more people, which increases their utility and therefore the price that can be set. But interoperability also means that both platforms propose the same level of network effects, and this intensifies competition. When a platform is small, it can only gain from interoperability. Conversely, if the platform is large, its users' gain will be limited whereas its competitor will now become more attractive. Consequently, a dominant platform's incentives to accept interoperability will be low (see Crémer et al., 20 0 0 ). 

多重归属。可以减轻倾斜的第二个因素是消费者可以选择多个平台，潜在地订阅超过一个平台。只要存在两个活跃的平台，并且一些主体选择只加入一个平台，其他主体将有动机同时订阅两个平台（这适用于媒体行业的广告商）。多重归属使主体能够从大规模网络效应和潜在的两个平台的服务中获益。相比之下，单一归属的主体可以节省一些成本，但可能无法与某些用户建立联系。因此，如果一些主体能够进行多重归属，则可能存在具有多个网络稳定情况的空间。关于是否可持续存在超过一个平台的问题将由成本结构和需求异质性驱动，即对服务估值和网络效应的不同看法。

互操作性。当平台决定或被迫采用某种互操作性时，拥有超过一个平台可能不会降低社会福利，因为每个用户即使只加入一个平台也可以与所有其他用户连接起来。但并不清楚所有平台都有动机接受这种互操作性。让我们回到两家公司A和B的案例中，假设公司A最初占据了市场份额较大于B。每家公司面临相同的权衡。通过允许互操作性，消费者与更多人连接，这增加了他们的效用，因此可以设定更高的价格。但互操作性也意味着两个平台提供相同水平的网络效应，这加剧了竞争。当一个平台很小时，它只能从互操作性中获益。相反，如果平台很大，则其用户的收益将受到限制，而其竞争对手现在将变得更具吸引力。因此，主导平台接受互操作性的动机将较低（参见Crémer等人, 2000年）。

We insisted that, in general, to avoid tipping, platforms must exhibit some form of differentiation, absent any interoperability or multi-homing. But two or more platforms can co-exist despite being formally homogenous if there is some congestion on at least one side, where congestion is defined as a reduction of network benefits on one side when more participants from this side join the platform. If a large platform becomes too congested, then the consumers most affected by congestion may prefer to join a smaller, less congested platform. This possibility is discussed by Karle et al. (2020) in the context of housing rental platforms where, while one side of the platform (sellers) values positively additional agents (consumers) on the other side, it values negatively agents on the same side because this intensifies competition. The authors showed that when the degree of competition between sellers is low, the platforms have strong incentives to attract as many sellers and buyers as possible. As they have the same objective and strategy, it is very likely that only one will survive. When competition is intense between sellers, some sellers may prefer to go to a smaller platform to escape competition even if it comes at the cost of reduced demand. Consumers will also split between the two platforms and there will be segmentation of the market. Of course, this reasoning is only valid if consumers singlehome. If they could multi-home, sellers would again all compete against each other, which tends to favor agglomeration and ultimately the survival of one platform only. Note also that ex-ante identical platforms may also achieve some ex-post differentiation by adapting their business model. For instance, an ad-free, pay service may coexist with a free, advertising-financed service (see the discussion of Calvano and Polo, 2020 in Section 2.3.1 ). 

我们坚持认为，为了避免小费，平台必须在没有互操作性或多重归属的情况下展示某种形式的差异化。然而，即使在形式上是同质的情况下，如果至少一方存在拥堵问题，则两个或更多个平台可以共存。这里所说的拥堵是指当更多来自该方的参与者加入平台时，该方网络效益减少。如果一个大型平台变得过于拥堵，那么受到拥堵影响最大的消费者可能会选择加入一个较小、不那么拥挤的平台。这种可能性在Karle等人（2020年）讨论了住房租赁平台的背景下进行了讨论，在该背景下，尽管平台一侧（卖家）对另一侧（消费者）额外主体持积极评价态度，但对于同一侧主体则持消极评价态度，因为这加剧了竞争。作者们表明，在卖家之间竞争程度较低时，平台有强烈动机吸引尽可能多的卖家和买家。由于它们具有相同的目标和策略，很可能只有一个平台能够生存下来。当卖家之间的竞争激烈时，一些卖家可能更愿意去一个较小的平台逃避竞争，即使这会导致需求减少。消费者也将在两个平台之间分散，市场将出现细分。当然，这种推理只在消费者单一归属的情况下有效。如果他们可以多重归属，则卖家再次会相互竞争，这有利于聚集，并最终只有一个平台能够生存下来。还要注意，事先相同的平台也可以通过调整其商业模式实现某种程度的事后差异化。例如，无广告、付费服务可以与免费、广告资助的服务共存（参见Calvano和Polo, 2020年第2.3.1节讨论）。

2.1.3. The dynamics of market *structure* 
How differentiation shapes the long-run market structure depends on the extent of differentiation relative to network effects and on the firms' pricing strategy. Cabral (2011) studies competition between two firms (A and B) which face a constant flow of new consumers and departure of old consumers. One important assumption is that a consumer stays on the same network until departure from the market. Demand is uncertain, as every new consumer can either be biased toward firm A or B, so it is not possible to predict with certainty which network consumers will choose in the future. When network effects are small, the differences in consumers' valuations of the two services prevail and, as in standard competition with product differentiation, the market converges dynamically to a stable situation where the two networks share the market. When network effects are large, Cabral (2011) shows that for a relatively long period of time firm A will have a large market share and firm B will stay small, until a sufficiently large shift in demand favors firm B. The market then tips toward B and a new period begins in which firm B has a large market share and firm A stays small, until a new cycle starts again. Hence, the market dynamics exhibits tipping with two characteristics. First, full monopolization doesn't happen; second, dominance is temporary. 

2.1.3. 市场结构的动态

市场结构的长期演变受到差异化程度相对于网络效应和企业定价策略的影响。Cabral（2011）研究了两家公司（A和B）之间的竞争，这两家公司面临着不断涌入新消费者和离开旧消费者的情况。一个重要假设是，消费者在离开市场之前会一直停留在同一个网络上。由于每个新消费者对A公司或B公司可能存在偏好，因此无法确定地预测未来消费者将选择哪个网络。当网络效应较小时，消费者对这两种服务的估值差异占主导地位，并且市场动态收敛到一个稳定状态，在该状态下两个网络共享市场，类似于标准差异化产品竞争。当网络效应较大时，Cabral（2011）表明，在相当长一段时间内，公司A将占据很大的市场份额而公司B将保持较小规模，直到需求发生足够大的转变有利于公司B。然后市场就会向B方倾斜，并开始一个新周期，在该周期中公司B占据很大的市场份额而公司A保持较小规模，直到再次开始一个新的周期。因此，市场动态呈现出两个特点：首先，完全垄断不会发生；其次，优势是暂时的。

An intriguing question is how the small network can survive long enough to take over when demand changes. To answer this, let us consider again the two-firm case discussed above and assume that firm A has captured significantly more consumers than firm B. If both firms set the same price, most new consumers would buy firm A's services. So B will choose low prices to adjust for his low quality whereas firm A will exploit its market power by charging a high price for large network benefits. In short, the exploitation of market power may lead the dominant network to accommodate the presence of a small competitor. An interesting conclusion from Cabral (2011) is that tipping should be understood as a dynamic process alternating periods of competition for the market and periods of dominance of one (or very few) network(s). 

一个引人入胜的问题是，当需求发生变化时，这个小网络如何能够存活足够长的时间以接管市场。为了回答这个问题，让我们再次考虑上面讨论过的两家公司情况，并假设公司A已经吸引了比公司B更多的消费者。如果两家公司设置相同的价格，大多数新消费者将选择购买公司A的服务。因此，公司B将选择降低价格来调整其低质量，而公司A则会利用其市场力量通过收取高价来获得大规模网络效益。简而言之，市场力量的利用可能导致主导网络容纳小竞争对手的存在。Cabral（2011）提出一个有趣的结论是，倾斜应该被理解为一种动态过程，交替出现市场竞争期和某个（或很少几个）网络占主导地位期。

This points to a difference between technological economies of scale, as experienced in many traditional network industries, and demand-driven returns to scale, as in most digital markets. In the former case, large fixed costs prevent the existence of small players. But in the latter case there is usually some heterogeneity and scope for horizontal differentiation. Given that entry costs are small in most digital markets, even if a market is prone to tipping there is the possibility for small niche entry exploiting heterogenous perceptions of network effects. For instance, a social network may focus on a small circle. Although there is no threat to the large dominant network in the short run, these small niche competitors will maintain some dynamic competitive pressure on the incumbent as they have the potential to become future challengers. 

这表明了技术规模经济与许多传统网络行业所经历的情况之间存在差异，以及需求驱动的规模回报与大多数数字市场之间的差异。在前一种情况下，大量固定成本阻止了小型参与者的存在。然而，在后一种情况下，通常存在一定程度的异质性和水平差异化的空间。考虑到大多数数字市场中进入成本较低，即使市场容易出现倾斜，仍有可能通过利用对网络效应的异质感知来进行小型利基进入。例如，一个社交网络可以专注于一个小圈子。虽然在短期内对大型主导网络没有威胁，但这些小型利基竞争对手将对现有企业保持一定的动态竞争压力，因为它们有潜力成为未来的挑战者。

## 2.2. Competition For The *Market*



We analyze in this section how firms compete when ultimately only one firm operates in a market, the case of competition for the market. 8 
2.2.1. Competition with incumbency *advantage* 
Can competition emerge when there is a firm already in place? There is a common belief that in the digital economy, because of network effects, the leader has such an important advantage that no entrant may be able to replace him. Even though this view is not unanimous (see Evans, 2017 ), it seems to be shared by many public decision-makers. To see when and how the dominant firm could be replaced by a new one, let us follow Halaburda et al. (2020) and consider two competing platforms, called A and B. Each platform offers a good that has a different level of quality –which is given here– and in addition provides network benefits increasing with the number of users on the same platform. We assume that network effects dominate quality effects, that is, for equal prices of the two platforms, the quality differential is not large enough to compensate for the network effect if all the agents choose the same platform. Despite this assumption, there is scope for competition when dynamics is fully taken into account. When consumers choose a platform, they do not know what other users will choose and the resulting equilibrium depends on the beliefs held by the agents about others' choice. Halaburda et al. (2020) rely on the notion of a focal platform to solve for this indeterminacy. A focal platform is one that every single agent believes will be chosen by the other agents when there is some indeterminacy. In this dynamic environment, the focal platform at any date is assumed to be the platform that was dominant the date before. This assumption is intuitive as the dominant platform enjoys what is referred to by Biglaiser et al. (2020) as an "incumbency" advantage. 9 While the incumbency advantage creates some barriers to entry, they may be weakened by dynamic competition considerations. The reason is that the prospective benefits of gaining future incumbency advantage for a superior quality entrant are larger than the prospective benefits of a lower quality incumbent preserving its position. Hence a high-quality, forward-looking entrant may be willing to sacrifice more in current competition than the low-quality incumbent. 

2.2.1. 具有现有企业优势的竞争

当市场上只有一家公司运营时，我们在本节中分析了企业如何进行竞争，即市场竞争的情况。能够在已经存在一家公司的情况下出现竞争吗？在数字经济中，由于网络效应的存在，人们普遍认为领先者具有如此重要的优势，以至于没有任何新进入者能够取代他。尽管这种观点并不是一致的（参见Evans, 2017），但似乎被许多公共决策者所认同。为了了解主导公司何时和如何可能被新公司取代，让我们按照Halaburda等人（2020）的方法来考虑两个竞争平台A和B。每个平台提供具有不同质量水平的商品，并且还提供随着在同一平台上使用用户数量增加而增加的网络效益。我们假设网络效应主导质量效应，也就是说，在两个平台价格相等时，如果所有主体选择相同的平台，则质量差异不足以弥补网络效应。尽管存在这种假设，在完全考虑动态因素时仍然存在竞争空间。当消费者选择一个平台时，他们不知道其他用户将选择什么，并且最终均衡取决于主体对其他人选择的信念。Halaburda等人（2020）依赖于“焦点平台”的概念来解决这种不确定性。焦点平台是每个主体都相信在存在某种不确定性时将被其他主体选择的平台。在这个动态环境中，任何日期的焦点平台被假设为前一天占主导地位的平台。这种假设是直观的，因为主导平台享有Biglaiser等人（2020）所称的“现有企业优势”。尽管现有企业优势会产生一些进入壁垒，但它们可能会受到动态竞争考虑因素的削弱。原因在于，对于一个具有更高质量、具有前瞻性眼光的新进入者来说，获得未来现有企业优势带来的潜在好处要大于低质量现有企业保持其地位所带来的潜在好处。因此，一个高质量、具有前瞻性眼光的新进入者可能愿意在当前竞争中付出更多牺牲，而低质量现有企业则无法做到这一点。

Let us now assume that platform A is focal and consider a simple one-period game. Platform A can then stay dominant even if it offers a lower quality than platform B. If B 
offers a price equal to the marginal cost per user (that is, the minimum price that does not generate negative profit) and A sets the same price, then all consumers strictly prefer to stay with A, even if B has superior quality. As they expect other consumers to stay with A, consumers compare A –with some network effects across all individuals–
with B –with a higher quality. According to our assumption, the network effects dominate so all consumers will choose A. A can even choose to raise its price, at least to a level equal to the perceived difference between the network effects and the quality effects. Suppose now that there are two periods. At the beginning of period 2, there is a focal firm which is the winner of the first-period competition. As we have discussed before, in a one-period setting, nothing can prevent the focal firm from winning the market. The meaningful analysis should then be on what occurred before this last period. 

假设平台A是焦点平台，并考虑一个简单的一期博弈。即使平台A的质量低于平台B，它仍然可以保持主导地位。如果B以每个用户的边际成本（即不会产生负利润的最低价格）提供价格，并且A设置相同的价格，那么所有消费者都会严格更喜欢选择留在A，即使B具有更高的质量。由于他们预期其他消费者会选择留在A，消费者将A（具有跨所有个体的某种网络效应）与B（具有更高质量）进行比较。根据我们的假设，网络效应占主导地位，因此所有消费者都将选择A。甚至可以选择提高价格，至少达到网络效应和质量效应之间感知差异相等的水平。现在假设有两个时期。在第二个时期开始时，存在一个焦点企业，该企业是第一时期竞争中获胜者。正如我们之前讨论过的，在一个一期设置中，没有什么能阻止焦点企业赢得市场份额。因此有意义的分析应该集中在最后一个时期之前发生了什么事情上。

At the beginning of period 1, suppose that A is focal. 

在第一时期的开始时，假设A是焦点平台。

B knows that if it sets the same price as A, it will not be able to win the market. But winning the first period market guarantees that it will win the second period, so B is willing to sacrifice a lot initially. If there are more than two periods, it is even easier for a more efficient entrant to overtake a less efficient incumbent. As soon as the entrant becomes the focal firm, there will be no way for the former incumbent to displace it. The more efficient firm will then be able to make some positive profit over a longer period, inducing this firm to be more aggressive initially. In short, in a dynamic framework, an initial advantage is not enough for a less efficient focal firm to maintain its dominant position. The higher the quality of the potential entrant, and the more periods the competition will last, the more aggressive the potential entrant will be at the earliest date in order to benefit for as many possible periods from its superior quality. If dynamics needs to be taken into account in the analysis, it is because some current losses can be recovered in the future but, at the same time, it is also because it may affect consumer beliefs and the relative position of the two firms with regard to incumbency advantage. 10 
2.2.2. Competitive pricing for the *market* 
Whereas Halaburda et al. (2020) focus on the role of dynamics in restoring efficiency and countervailing unfavorable beliefs, Caillaud and Jullien (20 01, 20 03) , look at the role of differentiated tariffs across sides. These contributions analyzed how an incumbent and a potential entrant optimize their prices in order to respectively protect or conquer the market. Caillaud and Jullien (2003) consider situations where the platform's only role is to match agents, even if the matching technology may be imperfect. In their model, there is no standalone value and therefore no utility gained on top of the utility obtained when two agents match. The agents originate from two different groups, called 1 and 2. Any match between a group- 1 agent and a group-2 agent generates a value for both agents. And platforms can use subscription fees as well as transaction fees. 

B明白如果与A设置相同的价格，将无法在市场上取胜。然而，赢得第一阶段的市场将确保其在第二阶段获胜，因此B愿意最初做出大量牺牲。如果有超过两个阶段，更高效的新进入者更容易超过效率较低的现任企业。一旦新进入者成为焦点企业，以前的现任企业将无法取代它。更高效的公司随后将能够在较长时间内获得一些正利润，并促使该公司最初更具侵略性。简而言之，在动态框架中，对于效率较低的焦点企业来说，初始优势是不足以维持其主导地位的。潜在进入者质量越高，并且竞争持续时间越长，则潜在进入者将在最早日期表现出更大侵略性，以从其卓越质量中尽可能多地受益。如果分析需要考虑动态因素，则是因为某些当前损失可以在未来恢复，但同时也可能影响消费者信念和两家公司相对于现任优势的相对位置。

2.2.2. 市场上的竞争定价
Halaburda等人（2020）关注动态恢复效率和抵消不利信念的作用，而Caillaud和Jullien（2001年，2003年）则研究了双方差异化关税在其中的作用。这些研究分析了现任企业和潜在进入者如何通过优化价格来保护或征服市场。Caillaud和Jullien（2003年）考虑了平台仅起到匹配主体作用的情况，即使匹配技术可能存在不完善之处。在他们的模型中，没有独立的价值，因此除了两个主体进行匹配时获得的效用外，没有额外的效用增益。主体来自两个不同的群体，分别称为1和2。群体1主体与群体2主体之间的任何匹配都会为两个主体带来价值。平台可以通过订阅费和交易费来实现收益。

When every agent can choose at most one of the two platforms (single-homing case), Caillaud and Jullien (2003) show that the incumbent ( I ) is able to prevent entry. 11 Still, this comes at the cost of profit dissipation, and the profit vanishes to zero. Note first that it is optimal that all agents join the same platform since the probability of a match is maximized. Suppose that initially, all agents subscribe to platform I , so any individual agent considering moving to the entrant E should be compensated. But attracting only one agent would not be enough, so E should separately convince many agents from one side to switch. If E were able to do that, agents from the other side would have no choice but to also join this new platform. Since attracting the first group of agents is costly, E should recover this cost by charging the final transaction at the maximal price. Strategies that subsidize participation on one side and recover the loss with the induced revenue on the other side are called 'divide and conquer' strategies and they are sometimes the only way for a platform to pave its way into a market. But it is unlikely that I 
will accept the loss of its customers with no reaction. The optimal way for I to prevent entry is to make sure that all sides remain faithful. It will then charge the maximal price for the final transaction, just like any entrant would do, but also redistribute this money ex ante by subsidizing subscription to its platform. In this way, I can deter entry. 

当每个主体最多只能选择两个平台之一（单向归属情况）时，Caillaud和Jullien（2003年）证明现有企业（I）能够阻止竞争者进入市场。然而，这种阻止竞争的方式会导致利润的消散，最终使得利润归零。首先需要注意的是，最优策略是所有主体都加入同一个平台，以最大化匹配的概率。假设初始情况下所有主体都订阅了平台I，因此任何考虑转移到新进者E的个体主体都应该得到补偿。但仅吸引一个主体是不够的，因此E需要分别说服一方的多个主体进行转换。如果E能够成功做到这一点，另一方的主体将别无选择，只能加入这个新平台。由于吸引第一组主体是有成本的，E应该通过以最高价格收取最终交易来收回这些成本。这种通过在一方面补贴参与，并通过另一方面引起收入来弥补损失的策略被称为“分而治之”策略，并且有时是一个平台进入市场唯一途径。然而现有企业不太可能接受失去客户而毫无反应。现有企业阻止竞争进入的最佳方式是确保所有方面都保持忠诚。因此，现有企业将对最终交易收取最高价格，就像任何竞争者一样，但也通过在事前补贴订阅其平台的方式重新分配这笔资金。通过这种方式，现有企业可以有效地阻止竞争进入。

The situation in which agents may opt for more than one platform (multi-homing case) leads to slightly different results. When the value of additional matches outweighs the cost for search by an additional platform, multi-homing is efficient and two platforms can operate profitably on the market. Note that the two platforms are different ex ante, I being the focal platform, so they will have different strategies and profits. I will make sure that E can only operate as a second source, that is E will realize the transaction only when the match has failed with I. I will make a larger profit than E , the latter being only able to capture the marginal value created by a second platform. When multi-homing is not efficient, I can prevent the entry of a new firm and still make a positive profit. This is achieved by setting a transaction fee equal to zero. In this case, platform E cannot subsidize the agents on one side at the registration stage as there will be no way to recover this money at the transaction stage if users multihome to trade on I 's platform. To sum up, there is an incumbency advantage in two-sided markets but the possibility for an entrant either to use a divide-and-conquer strategy or to act as a second source when multi-homing is efficient reduces the strength of this advantage. 

当主体可以选择多个平台（多重入住情况）时，会导致略有不同的结果。当额外匹配的价值超过额外平台搜索成本时，多重入住是有效的，两个平台可以在市场上盈利。需要注意的是，两个平台在事前是不同的，I是焦点平台，因此它们将有不同的策略和利润。我将确保E只能作为第二来源运营，即只有在与I匹配失败时才能实现交易。我将获得比E更大的利润，后者只能捕捉到第二个平台所创造的边际价值。当多重入住无效时，我可以阻止新公司进入并仍然获得正面利润。这通过设置等于零的交易费用来实现。在这种情况下，E平台无法在注册阶段对一方主体进行补贴，因为如果用户选择同时使用I平台进行交易，则无法在交易阶段回收这笔资金。总之，在双边市场中存在现有企业优势，但当多重入住有效时，新进者要么使用分而治之策略要么充当第二来源都会削弱这种优势的力量。

As a complement, let us remark that Caillaud and Jullien (2003) focus on the case where there are only inter-group externalities. Belleflamme and Toulemonde (2009) have shown that intra-group externalities (for example congestion on one side) have a dual effect on the ability of an entrant to overtake an incumbent. On the one hand, it is easier to attract some agents from the congested side since these agents are ready to pay a premium to be in a small group. On the other hand, when the number of agents from the congested side is low on a given platform, it is hard to convince the other side to join this platform. Moreover, Caillaud and Jullien (2003) focused on pure intermediaries, where value is only generated when two sides are on board. Jullien (2011) extends the analysis to situations where the standalone value offered by a platform is large and shows that a divide-and-conquer strategy by an entrant is more effective at overcoming the incumbency advantage. 

作为补充说明，我们需要注意的是，Caillaud和Jullien（2003）的研究聚焦于仅存在组间外部性的情况。而Belleflamme和Toulemonde（2009）则指出组内外部性（例如一方拥堵）对于新进者超越现有企业的能力具有双重影响。一方面，吸引来自拥堵一方的主体更容易，因为这些主体愿意支付额外费用以加入一个小团体。另一方面，在给定平台上，当来自拥堵一方的主体数量较少时，很难说服另一方加入该平台。此外，Caillaud和Jullien（2003）关注纯粹中介机构，在两个方面都参与时才会产生价值。而Jullien（2011）将分析扩展到独立价值由一个平台提供且较大的情况，并表明新进者采取分而治之策略更有效地克服现有企业优势。

To which extent can we believe that effective competition for the market is feasible? As with most network goods, beliefs are crucial and provide a key advantage to the incumbent. Still, if the horizon is long enough, an incumbent's position can be contested by an entrant of superior quality, provided it has enough financial resources. Taking explicitly a multi-sided approach does not fundamentally change the conclusions. Entrants can try to focus on one side, using a-divide-and-conquer strategy, to lower the cost of entry. But the presence of different groups also lowers the cost for the incumbent to deter this entry. This question relates to the debate on exclusionary pricing that will be discussed in Section 3.2 . 

在多大程度上我们可以相信市场上的有效竞争是可行的？与大多数网络产品一样，信念至关重要，并为现有企业提供了关键优势。然而，如果时间跨度足够长，只要新进者拥有足够的财务资源，就可以挑战现有企业的地位。明确采用多边方法并不从根本上改变结论。新进者可以尝试专注于一方面，采用分而治之的策略来降低进入成本。但不同群体的存在也降低了现有企业阻止此类进入的成本。这个问题涉及到将在第3.2节中讨论的排斥性定价辩论。

## 2.3. Competition Within The *Market*



In this section, we are interested in the competition between platforms when the market structure has stabilized, that is when consumers have coordinated on a stable market allocation with more than one platform. 12 Despite network effects, this competition within the market occurs either because of platform differentiation–making a distinction between product and business model differentiation–
or because of multi-homing. 13 
2.3.1. Platform *differentiation* 
Platform differentiation can be based on the type of product proposed or platforms can differentiate by adopting different pricing strategies or different business models. We look at these two approaches each in turn. 

本节我们关注的是市场结构稳定时平台之间的竞争，即当消费者在多个平台上协调达成稳定的市场分配时。尽管存在网络效应，但市场内的竞争要么是因为平台差异化（即产品和商业模式的差异化），要么是因为多重使用。平台差异化可以基于所提供产品的类型，也可以通过采用不同的定价策略或商业模式来实现。我们将分别研究这两种方法。

Armstrong (2006) follows the first approach, focusing on exogenous product differentiation. This article considers duopoly competition between platforms that sell a horizontally differentiated consum ption good with twosided network externalities and intrinsic values to consumers. There are two sides (1 and 2) interested in the good who care about the other side's demand for the good they buy. Preferences over the two goods are modeled by means of the Hotelling model, and each side singlehomes. Armstrong (2006) characterizes the equilibrium prices set by the two platforms, and analyzes the role of network effects in shaping these prices. A key insight from Armstrong (2006) is that indirect (cross-sides) network effects tend to increase the elasticity of demand perceived by each platform on both sides of the market. Higher elastic demand means that increasing one price induces a higher loss of sales on both sides of the market. When a consumer on side 1 leaves the platform, network externalities are reduced on the other side, inducing lower demand on side 2 
and, by a feedback effect, lower value and lower demand on side 1. As a consequence, firms refrain from increasing prices and competition is more intense. To put it differently, there are three reasons for a platform to attract a new customer. First, this platform can earn a markup, as in any market. Second, it increases the price the platform can charge to the other side, because of higher network effects. Third, it reduces the attractiveness of its competitor, who lost a client, and offers lower network effects. So, the optimal price is given by price = cost + markup - value created on other *side* - 
competitor value *destroyed.* (1) 
Note that Armstrong's analysis is restricted to the case where there are two platforms and two sides. But the intuition is more general. As long as network effects are not too large, Tan and Zhou (2017) show that the pricing formula derived by Armstrong can be generalized to the case where there are many more sides and many more platforms. 

Armstrong（2006）采用了第一种方法，专注于外生产品差异化。本文考虑了销售具有双边网络外部性和对消费者具有内在价值的水平差异化消费品的两个平台之间的垄断竞争。存在两个方面（1和2）对该商品感兴趣，并关心另一方面对其购买商品的需求。通过Hotelling模型来建模这两种商品的偏好，并且每个方面都单独居住。Armstrong（2006）描述了由两个平台设定的均衡价格，并分析了网络效应在塑造这些价格中的作用。Armstrong（2006）得出的一个关键见解是，间接（跨边界）网络效应倾向于增加市场两侧每个平台所感知到的需求弹性。需求弹性更高意味着提高一个价格会导致市场两侧销售额更大程度上损失。当第一方面的消费者离开平台时，其他方面上的网络外部性减少，从而降低第二方面上的需求，并通过反馈效应降低第一方面上的价值和需求。因此，企业避免提高价格并且竞争更加激烈。换句话说，平台吸引新客户有三个原因。首先，该平台可以获得利润，就像在任何市场中一样。其次，由于更高的网络效应，它增加了该平台可以向另一方面收取的价格。第三，它降低了竞争对手的吸引力，因为竞争对手失去了一个客户，并提供较低的网络效应。因此，最优价格由价格=成本+利润+其他*方面*上创造的价值-竞争对手价值*销毁*（1）给出。
请注意，Armstrong的分析仅限于存在两个平台和两个方面的情况。但是这种直观更具普遍性。只要网络效应不是太大，Tan和Zhou（2017）表明Armstrong推导出来的定价公式可以推广到存在更多方面和更多平台的情况下。

The possibility of competition on the market relies on the presence of heterogenous standalone values, as network effects alone tend to generate tipping. But it is difficult for an agent to guess how other agents value each platform. This raises the question of how one can account for this uncertainty about the others' preferences and therefore their willingness to join one of the platforms. This issue has been studied recently by Jullien and Pavan (2018) in a model that shares many features with Armstrong (2006) . The additional twist comes from the fact that agents can have different beliefs about other consumers' preferences and therefore about the number of people who, for given prices, could join the other side. To put it differently, it is assumed that the average preference in the population is unknown and can favor either platform. And each agent will use his own taste parameter to update his belief on this average preference and guess likely participation levels on each platform. Let us consider the case of aligned preferences (positive correlation of preferences across sides). In this case, an agent from side 1 with a strong preference for a platform anticipates that many agents on the other side will also have a strong preference. Any price increase on that side will discourage the weakest-preference consumers from buying and thereby increase the marginal agent's belief about the other side's willingness to participate. Because inframarginal agents are more optimistic about the value of participation than marginal agents, fewer agents are discouraged by the price increase than if all agents shared the same beliefs. In other words, in the case of aligned preferences, the demand elasticity is lower when consumers are uncertain about demand. Each platform can set higher prices. And the reverse holds when preferences are negatively correlated across sides. A consequence of these findings is that, in the simple case of single-homing, platforms can alter the intensity of competition by manipulating the information flow to consumers. By giving more or less information about the taste of the different sides for their good, firms can change the consumers' beliefs and therefore equilibrium prices. Communication campaigns, e.g. advertising, show-rooming or free trial, that inform users about the product may then have an anti-competitive effect on prices that ultimately hurts consumers. Likewise better information about realized participation on each side may soften competition. 

市场竞争的可能性取决于存在异质独立价值，因为仅凭网络效应往往会产生倾斜。然而，一个经济主体很难猜测其他经济主体如何评估每个平台的价值。这引发了一个问题，即如何考虑对其他人偏好的不确定性以及因此他们愿意加入哪个平台。最近，Jullien和Pavan（2018）在一个与Armstrong（2006）有许多相似之处的模型中研究了这个问题。额外的复杂性来自于经济主体可以对其他消费者的偏好以及因此在给定价格下可能加入另一方面的人数持有不同的信念。换句话说，我们假设人群中平均偏好是未知的，并且可以支持任一平台。每个经济主体将使用自己的品味参数来更新对这种平均偏好的信念，并猜测每个平台上可能参与水平。让我们考虑一致偏好（两边之间偏好正相关）情况下。在这种情况下，具有强烈对某个平台偏好的第一方面上经济主体预计，在另一方面上也会有许多经济主体强烈地倾向于该平台。该方面上的任何价格上涨都会阻止最弱偏好的消费者购买，并因此增加边际经济主体对另一方面愿意参与的信念。由于非边际经济主体对参与价值更为乐观，所以受到价格上涨的影响较少，比起所有经济主体共享相同信念时要少。换句话说，在一致偏好情况下，当消费者对需求不确定时，需求弹性较低。每个平台可以设定更高的价格。而当两边之间的偏好呈负相关时，则相反成立。这些发现的一个结果是，在单一居住（single-homing）简单情况下，平台可以通过操纵向消费者传递信息来改变竞争强度。通过提供有关不同方面对其产品品味的更多或更少信息，企业可以改变消费者的信念，从而影响均衡价格。例如广告、展示厅或免费试用等沟通活动向用户提供有关产品信息可能会对最终伤害消费者产生反竞争效应。同样，有关每个方面实际参与情况的更好信息可能会减轻竞争。

An alternative to differentiation in products is for platforms to differentiate their business models. Adopting different price skewness to court different segments from competitors on each side of the market is one way to propose a different value than competitors. An illustration is provided by Ambrus and Argenziano (2009) who investigate the conditions for the existence of asymmetric networks, as for example, in the market for online job search in the US or in the credit card industry. They assume that on each side, there are two types of consumers, some who value large networks highly and a large mass of others who have a low valuation for large networks. Each platform's optimal strategy is to set a low price on one side (side 1 for example), in order to attract the large mass of consumers with low valuation and set a high price on the other side (then side 2). If one platform proposes low prices on side 1 and high prices on side 2, the other platform should do the opposite and propose low prices on side 2 - because there are many agents still free - and high prices on side 1 - for the consumers who value being connected to many agents from the other side. In the case of online job search, there will be two active platforms, one with more job posts and the other with more job candidates. 

在产品差异化之外，平台可以通过差异化其商业模式来实现区别。采用不同的价格偏斜以吸引市场两侧的不同细分群体是提出与竞争对手不同价值的一种方式。Ambrus和Argenziano（2009）提供了一个例子，他们研究了非对称网络存在的条件，例如美国在线求职市场或信用卡行业。他们假设在每一方面都有两类消费者，一些人高度重视大型网络，而大多数其他人对大型网络的估值较低。每个平台的最佳策略是在一侧（例如第1侧）设置低价格，以吸引估值较低的大多数消费者，并在另一侧（第2侧）设置高价格。如果一个平台在第1侧提出低价，在第2侧提出高价，则另一个平台应该相反地提出低价 - 因为仍然有许多自由主体 - 并且在第1侧提出高价 - 针对那些希望与来自另一方面的许多主体保持联系的消费者。在线求职市场上将会有两个活跃平台，一个拥有更多职位发布信息，另一个拥有更多求职者信息。

Competing firms can also adopt a business model that is attractive to a specific set of consumers. Calvano and Polo (2020) study this possibility in the media market. They showed that if one media outlet chooses an Free-To- 
Air business model, the other may have some incentives to choose the Pay-TV business model. When one media increases the level of advertising and reduces the viewers' subscription fee, it induces the other to do the reverse - that is, to decrease the level of advertising and increase the viewers' subscription fee. This comes from the fact that the two media are substitutable channels for conveying the same advertising content when consumers view the two outlets. The value of pursuing the same strategy is therefore reduced. 

竞争对手还可以采用吸引特定消费者群体的商业模式。Calvano和Polo（2020）在媒体市场中研究了这种可能性。他们发现，如果一个媒体机构选择了免费电视业务模式，另一个可能会有一些动机选择付费电视业务模式。当一个媒体机构增加广告水平并降低观众的订阅费时，它会促使另一个媒体机构采取相反的策略 - 也就是减少广告水平并增加观众的订阅费。这是因为当消费者同时观看两个媒体时，这两个媒体都是传递相同广告内容的可替代渠道。追求相同策略的价值因此降低了。

Even if most models focus on price competition, firms can also compete in other dimensions on the Internet. For example, Casadesus-Masanell and Hervas- Drane (2015) propose an analysis in which firms provide the same basic service and then compete on price and information disclosure. Firms will opt for different levels of information disclosure, thereby achieving a vertical differentiation of their products. It shows again that different possible models (paid/free) can co-exist in the same internet market. 

尽管大多数模型侧重于价格竞争，但企业在互联网上也可以在其他方面展开竞争。例如，Casadesus-Masanell和Hervas-Drane（2015）提出了一种分析方法，其中企业提供相同的基本服务，然后通过价格和信息披露进行竞争。企业可以选择不同水平的信息披露，从而实现其产品的垂直差异化。这再次证明了在同一个互联网市场中可以存在不同的模式（付费/免费）共存的可能性。

2.3.2. *Multi-homing* 
The previous contributions share the important assumption that each agent could only join one platform. How robust are the ideas developed above to the possibility of multi-homing? Let us discuss this question using again the model developed by Armstrong (2006) but assuming that one side, say side 1, still single-homes while the other side, therefore side 2, wants to join both platforms. This multi-homing behavior dramatically changes the competition between platforms. As far as side 2 is concerned, the agents make their choice to join each platform separately. Given that a side-2 consumer can join both platforms, there is no more direct competition to attract consumers from this side. 14 
This lack of competition has the immediate consequence of changing the bargaining power between the agents and the platform. Indeed, because each side-1 user single-homes, these users are a scarce resource for which each platform is ready to fight. And if any side-2 agent wants to be connected to a specific agent from the other side, they have to join the platform this specific agent has joined. In this case, the platforms act as competitive bottlenecks. Consequently, they will raise their price on side 2, leading to too few of these agents on their networks. As far as the price on side 1 is concerned, it is more ambiguous. On the one hand, the value destroyed for a competitor by attracting some of its side-1 customers does not transform into a competitive edge on side 2 since there is no direct competition anymore. On the other hand, the value generated is larger because of larger market size under multi-homing. Note that the impact of multi-homing on the price can be understood by using Equation (1) derived in Section 2.3.1 . Indeed, as far as side-2 agents are concerned, there is no more value destroyed for the competitor if the marginal consumer attracted multi-homes. Therefore the last term vanishes and the price goes up. Regarding side-1, the last term also vanishes, because a multi-homing side-2 agent cares only about the incremental value of the platform on side-1 instead of the differential value between the two platforms. But the first term increases because multi-homing raises side-2 participation. Therefore, the single-homing side can benefit or lose from the introduction of multi-homing on the other side (see Belleflamme and Peitz, 2019 ). This issue of multi-homing vs. single homing is thus crucial to understanding properly how platform competition takes place. 

2.3.2. *多重入住*

前述研究都基于一个重要假设，即每个参与者只能加入一个平台。然而，对于多重入住的可能性，上述观点的鲁棒性如何？我们再次使用Armstrong（2006）所提出的模型来探讨这个问题，但假设一方（称为方1）仍然只选择单一平台，而另一方（即方2）希望加入两个平台。这种多重入住行为极大地改变了平台之间的竞争格局。对于方2而言，参与者们可以分别选择加入每个平台。由于方2消费者可以同时加入两个平台，因此不再存在直接竞争来吸引这一方的消费者。

这种缺乏竞争导致了参与者和平台之间谈判权力的变化。事实上，由于每个方1用户只选择一个平台进行入住，这些用户成为了稀缺资源，每个平台都愿意争夺他们。如果任何一个方2参与者想要与另一方特定参与者建立连接，则必须加入该特定参与者所在的平台。在这种情况下，各个平台充当了竞争瓶颈。因此，它们会提高方2上的价格，导致网络上这些参与者数量减少。至于方1的价格，情况更加模糊。一方面，通过吸引一些方1客户来破坏竞争对手的价值不再转化为在方2上的竞争优势，因为不再存在直接竞争。另一方面，在多重入住下，由于市场规模更大，产生的价值也更大。请注意，可以通过使用第2.3.1节推导出的公式（1）来理解多重入住对价格的影响。事实上，在涉及到方2参与者时，如果边际消费者是多重入住者，则不会对竞争对手造成价值破坏。因此最后一项消失了，并且价格上升了。至于方1而言，最后一项也消失了，因为多重入住的方2参与者只关心平台在方1上的增量价值而不是两个平台之间的差异价值。但第一项增加了，因为多重入住提高了方2参与度。因此，在正确理解平台竞争发生方式时，多重入住与单一入住之间的问题至关重要。（参见Belleflamme和Peitz, 2019）。

The original contribution of Rochet and Tirole (2003) provides an alternative set-up in the case of transaction platforms, that is when platforms control the transaction between sides and thus can set fees per transaction. 15 They consider a situation in which some platforms intermediate trades between buyers and sellers but, in contrast to Armstrong (2006) , the price paid by each agent is only a transaction fee, and not a subscription fee. Buyers have preferences for platforms but they may decide to join both if their preferences are weak. This means that some buyers, those with strong preferences, will single-home as in Armstrong (2006) whereas others, those with weak preference, will multi-home. On the sellers' side, they must decide whether they are ready to accept trades on both platforms. If they are, the platform on which the trade is made is determined by the buyer. If a seller chooses to join one platform only, the one that sets the lowest transaction fee, it limits the number of potential trades (because some consumers will refuse to trade on this platform) but increases the average revenue as the seller will realize all its trades on the cheapest platform. As in Armstrong (2006) , prices depend on the cost, on the externality generated on the other side but also on the elasticity of demand. As far as buyers are concerned, this elasticity depends on the price and on the consumer's preference toward one platform or the other. The specificity lies in the way platforms set their prices for sellers. Let us assume that a seller has already joined platform A. This means that this seller is able to trade with all the buyers on this platform. If the seller also joins platform B, this increases the number of potential trades, because some single-homing buyers join platform B only. The more buyers are loyal to platform B, the more it pays for a seller to join this platform. Therefore, the price this platform will be able to charge for this seller increases in relation to the percentage of loyal (or single-homing) buyers. This contribution highlights the idea that platform prices targeted at multi-homers are set in proportion to the incremental value generated by the platform. In media markets, or in the context where some advertisers constitute one side of the market, this value is the gain attached to increased exposure, in particular to new consumers (see Anderson et al., 2017 ). Similarly, the incremental value of joining several social networks may lie in the ability to reach more friends, different content focus and privacy concerns. This incremental pricing principle is at play in most models of platform competition and explains why the issue of single-homing vs. multi-homing must be accounted for. 

Rochet和Tirole（2003）的研究提供了一种针对交易平台的替代模型，即当平台控制交易并能够设定每笔交易的费用时。他们考虑了一种情况，即一些平台在买家和卖家之间进行交易中介。与Armstrong（2006）不同的是，每个参与者只需支付交易费用而非订阅费用。买家对平台有偏好，但如果偏好较弱，则可能同时加入两个平台。这意味着一些具有强烈偏好的买家将选择单一入住，而其他具有较弱偏好的买家将选择多重入住。在卖方方面，他们必须决定是否愿意在两个平台上接受交易。如果愿意，在哪个平台进行交易由买方决定。如果卖方选择只加入一个平台，并且该平台设置最低的交易费用，则限制了潜在交易数量（因为某些消费者将拒绝在该平台上进行交易），但增加了平均收入，因为卖方将在最便宜的平台上实现所有交易。与Armstrong（2006）类似，价格取决于成本、对另一方产生的外部性以及需求的弹性。对于买家而言，这种弹性取决于价格和消费者对其中一个平台的偏好程度。平台为卖方设定价格的方式具有特殊性。假设卖方已经加入A平台，这意味着该卖方能够与该平台上的所有买家进行交易。如果卖方还加入B平台，这将增加潜在交易数量，因为一些单一入住的买家只加入B平台。买家对B平台的忠诚程度越高，卖方加入该平台所能收取的价格就会相应增加。因此，针对多重入住者定价的目标是根据平台带来的增量价值来设定的。在媒体市场或某些广告商构成市场一侧时，这个增量价值体现在扩大曝光度、吸引新消费者等方面。类似地，在参与多个社交网络时，加入更多网络可能会带来更多朋友、不同内容关注点和隐私问题等增量价值。这种增量定价原则适用于大多数平台竞争模型，并解释了为什么必须考虑单一入住与多重入住问题。

## 2.4. Remarks On Coordination And *Beliefs*



Coordination between users, both at the level of consumers and of firms, is a key aspect of platform competition. As this coordination of action is driven by the beliefs agents can hold, the way beliefs are formed and modeled plays a crucial role in the analysis of platform competition. 

2.4. 关于协调和信念的注解

用户之间的协调，无论是消费者还是企业，都是平台竞争的关键方面。由于行动的协调受到主体可能持有的信念驱动，信念形成和建模方式在分析平台竞争中起着至关重要的作用。

Let us first start by discussing the role of beliefs on market outcomes in the case of an emerging firm proposing a network good. The benefits derived by any user from a network good depends on the characteristics of the good but also the number of other users. When evaluating this latter network benefits, a potential user must form some anticipations on the behavior of other users. In this static setting, the natural assumption is to assume fulfilled expectations. If potential users only differ in standalone value for the good, some users are more eager to buy the good because this value is high whereas others will buy the good only if they believe that enough people will do so. When network effects are the dominant element driving the consumers' decision, there may exist several stable demand configurations, with various levels of participation. A low level of participation reduces the value of the good which makes it rational for a large part of consumers not to buy, while a large level of participation induces more consumers to buy. Of course, prices matter. Indeed, suppose that the price is above the highest standalone value but below the maximal value of network effects (obtained when all consumers buy the good). When the market share is zero, there is not enough benefit for the first agent to join the network. Conversely, when the market share is one, the total benefit (standalone value plus the total externality) is more than enough to induce the last consumer to join if all the others have already joined the network. So we may end up with a final situation in which there is no user, but it is also possible that all consumers adopt the network good. And also potentially an intermediate equilibrium where a subset of the most eager users buy the good. 16 
When firms compete with network effects, the market outcome is again shaped by consumers' beliefs. But the issues are even more complex than above as one must consider not only participation in the market but also how this participation is shared across platforms. The situation is, therefore, one of competition with externality. Two main questions arise in this context, the first related to coordination and the second to information. 

首先，让我们探讨一下新兴企业提出网络产品时，信念对市场结果的影响。用户对网络产品的好处取决于产品特性和其他用户的数量。在评估这种网络效益时，潜在用户必须对其他用户的行为形成一些预期。在这个静态环境中，自然而然的假设是满足预期。如果潜在用户只有在独立价值高时才愿意购买该产品，那么一些用户会更渴望购买该产品，因为他们认为其价值很高，而其他人则只有在相信足够多的人会购买时才会购买。当网络效应成为驱动消费者决策的主要因素时，可能存在多种稳定需求配置方案，并具有不同程度的参与度。低参与水平降低了产品价值，使得大部分消费者理性地选择不购买；而高参与水平则促使更多消费者购买。当然，价格也很重要。假设价格高于最高独立价值但低于网络效应的最大值（即所有消费者都购买该产品时获得的效益），当市场份额为零时，第一个加入网络的用户没有足够好处；相反地，在市场份额为一时，总效益（独立价值加上总外部性）超过足够诱使最后一个消费者加入网络的程度，前提是其他所有人已经加入了网络。因此，我们可能会出现这样的最终情况：没有用户，但也有可能所有消费者都采用了该网络产品。还有可能出现中间均衡状态，其中一部分最渴望购买该产品的用户购买了它。

当企业在网络效应下竞争时，市场结果再次受到消费者信念的影响。但问题比上述情况更为复杂，因为不仅必须考虑市场参与度，还必须考虑参与度如何在平台之间共享。因此，这种情况是一种带有外部性的竞争。在这种背景下出现了两个主要问题：第一个问题与协调相关，第二个问题与信息相关。

First, coordination issues arise when there are multiple equilibrium allocations of consumers across platforms and the way the equilibrium is selected affects the market dynamics. Focality or incumbency advantage is an illustration of this. In this case, consumers' expectations tend to advantage one platform over the others which may lead to excess inertia or excess momentum (see Farrell and Saloner, 1985 ). However, markets can coordinate in different ways. For instance, many authors assume away coordination failures by focusing on allocations that are optimal from consumers' perspective or by simply assuming that platforms can choose quantities on each side of the market (see Rochet, Tirole, 2006 ). Weyl (2010) and Weyl and White (2016) argue that platforms have enough pricing instruments to overcome the coordination problem. They define an equilibrium concept, insulated equilibrium, based on the idea that prices are designed in such a way that participation on one side is not affected (at the margin) by participation on the other side. 

首先，当存在多个平台之间的消费者均衡分配时，协调问题就会出现。选择均衡的方式会影响市场动态。焦点或现有优势是这一问题的一个例子。在这种情况下，消费者的期望往往会使一个平台相对于其他平台具有优势，从而可能导致过度惯性或过度动量（参见Farrell和Saloner, 1985）。然而，市场可以以不同的方式进行协调。例如，许多作者通过关注从消费者角度来看最优的分配，或者简单地假设平台可以在市场两侧选择数量来排除协调失败（参见Rochet、Tirole, 2006）。Weyl (2010) 和 Weyl 和 White (2016) 认为平台拥有足够的定价工具来克服协调问题。他们提出了一个基于价格设计的均衡概念——隔离均衡，在这种均衡中，一方面的参与（边际上）不受另一方面参与的影响。

While solving coordination issues may favor economic efficiency, it may not benefit consumers because coordination failure may protect them against excessive use of market power. To illustrate this, consider a monopoly platform facing "unfavorable beliefs". Consumers will benefit if the platform must subsidize participation on one side to overcome the coordination issue. If instead consumers coordinate most efficiently, the platform can extract all the surplus from consumers by charging high prices on both sides because consumers expect others to participate. Regarding platform competition, it is important to realize that not only consumers' beliefs matter but also the interaction with firms' beliefs. Indeed the intensity of competition at a given period depends on firms' beliefs about which firms will be favored by consumers in the future. In Halaburda et al. (2020) , it is shown that this generates multiple equilibria when firms are forward-looking, one in which the incumbent is never displaced and would fight very aggressively to regain market leadership if it were to lose it. Also, entry may be impeded if it takes very long to change consumers' beliefs. 

尽管解决协调问题可能有利于经济效率，但对消费者来说可能并不受益，因为协调失败可能会保护他们免受市场力量的过度使用。为了说明这一点，我们可以考虑一个面临“不利信念”的垄断平台。如果平台必须通过在一方面补贴参与来解决协调问题，那么消费者将从中受益。然而，如果消费者能够最有效地进行协调，那么平台就可以通过在两个方面收取高价来从消费者那里获取全部剩余价值，因为消费者预期其他人也会参与其中。

在考虑平台竞争时，我们需要意识到不仅消费者的信念很重要，与企业的信念相互作用也同样重要。事实上，在特定时期内竞争的激烈程度取决于企业对未来哪些企业会得到消费者青睐的信念。Halaburda等人（2020）的研究表明，在企业具有前瞻性时会出现多个均衡状态。其中一个均衡状态是现有企业永远不会被替代，并且如果失去市场领导地位，则会非常积极地争夺恢复市场领导地位。此外，如果需要很长时间才能改变消费者的信念，那么新企业进入市场可能会受到阻碍。

The second issue relates to consumers' information and demand elasticity. This was illustrated by the work of Jullien and Pavan (2018) on consumers' beliefs and information. As consumers must anticipate participation on the other side, the equilibrium depends on how these expectations are formed. The most prominent view ( Caillaud and Jullien, 2003; Rochet and Tirole, 2003 ) is that when prices change, consumers adjust their beliefs and correctly anticipate the participation on the other side (referred to as rational expectations). This view emphasizes the role of feedback effects between sides and may prevail if demand adjusts fast. However, an alternative view is that consumers hold fixed beliefs about the other side's participation that do not vary when prices change (although beliefs are assumed to be correct at the equilibrium market price). 17 Because this approach assumes less internalization of network externalities by consumers, it leads to less elastic demands and thus to higher equilibrium prices (see Hagiu and Halaburda, 2014 ). The same remark holds for the Cournot assumption that firms choose volumes on each side and volumes are correctly anticipated by consumers. 

第二个问题涉及消费者的信息和需求弹性。Jullien和Pavan（2018）在消费者信念和信息方面的研究阐明了这一点。由于消费者必须预期另一方的参与，因此均衡取决于这些预期是如何形成的。最突出的观点（Caillaud和Jullien，2003; Rochet和Tirole，2003）认为，当价格发生变化时，消费者会调整他们的信念，并正确地预期另一方的参与（称为理性预期）。这种观点强调了双方之间反馈效应的作用，并且在需求快速调整时可能占主导地位。然而，还有一种观点认为，消费者对于价格变动时对方参与持有固定的信念（尽管假设在均衡市场价格下信念是正确的）。由于这种方法假设消费者对网络外部性内化程度较低，因此导致需求不太弹性，并且从而导致更高的均衡价格（参见Hagiu和Halaburda, 2014）。Cournot假设也存在相同情况，即企业选择每一方面积极并且积极被消费者正确地预期。

Users' anticipations are crucial when network effects are present, both in one-sided and two-sided contexts. This implies that first it is hard to predict which platforms consumers will join when they have the choice and second that platforms have incentives to influence user's belief (see the discussion of Jullien and Pavan, 2018 ). Therefore, the conclusions that can be drawn from current models of platform competition should be taken with caution when applied to actual markets. 

当存在网络效应时，用户的期望对于单边和双边情境都至关重要。这意味着首先很难预测消费者在有选择权时会加入哪个平台，其次平台有动机影响用户的信念（参见Jullien和Pavan, 2018的讨论）。因此，在将当前的平台竞争模型应用于实际市场时，需要谨慎得出结论。

## 3. Competition **Policy**



At the general level, the difficulty for competition policy comes from the lack of a proper competitive benchmark for activities involving large demand externalities, such as those induced by network effects. 18 With network externalities, the link between competition and consumer surplus is more complex and subtle than in markets without network effects, as some user prices may fall and network externalities may be better internalized with less competition, increasing consumer surplus. 

在一般层面上，竞争政策面临的困难源于缺乏涉及大规模需求外部性的活动的适当竞争基准，例如由网络效应引起的外部性。具有网络外部性时，竞争与消费者剩余之间的联系比没有网络效应的市场更加复杂和微妙，因为一些用户价格可能会下降，并且通过较少的竞争可以更好地内化网络外部性，从而增加消费者剩余。

The contributions discussed below help framing and understanding platform conducts. But before we discuss these contributions, three points are worth noticing. First dynamic competition, innovation or behavioral factors affecting platforms are currently insufficiently understood. Second, efficiencies arising from a particular conduct will be considered by authorities only if deemed necessary and theory papers do not always consider alternative ways to achieve efficiencies. Third, while platform activities create new opportunities for abusive conduct, the main question is often not so much whether a powerful platform has the ability to do so, but rather whether it has the incentives to do so. 

下面讨论的贡献有助于框架化和理解平台行为。然而，在我们讨论这些贡献之前，有三个值得注意的要点。首先，目前对于影响平台的动态竞争、创新或行为因素的理解还不够充分。其次，只有当被认为是必要的时候，当局才会考虑某种行为所带来的效率。理论论文并不总是考虑实现效率的替代途径。第三，尽管平台活动创造了滥用行为的新机会，但主要问题往往不在于一个强大平台是否有能力这样做，而在于它是否有动机这样做。

[参考原文进行重写:]

In what follows, we focus on what is new about platforms that differs from traditional markets. Of course, this does not mean that traditional analysis of anti-competitive conducts never applies to platforms; it often does. After discussing the market power of platforms, we will examine the following issues: exclusionary pricing and predation, exclusivity, bundling, vertical foreclosure, collusion, and merger policy. 19 

在接下来的内容中，我们将着重探讨平台与传统市场的新特点。当然，并不意味着传统对反竞争行为的分析在平台上从不适用；事实上，它通常是适用的。在讨论平台的市场力量之后，我们将详细研究以下问题：排斥性定价和掠夺、独家经营、捆绑销售、垂直封锁、勾结以及合并政策。19

## 3.1. Market *Power*



A well-known difficulty in identifying market power is that platforms may implement strong price skewness, with some sides being charged low or zero prices and others being charged relatively high prices (see Sections 2.2.2 and 
2.3.1 ). 20 Thus, when looking at margins, the whole structure across all sides should be considered. 21 
This is illustrated by the competitive bottleneck model discussed before. An ad-financed platform may generate little profit because it competes harshly to capture and retain consumers. However, based on the analysis of the competitive bottleneck, there should be no presumption that the outcome is efficient and that profit dissipation can free a platform from anti-trust scrutiny. 

在确定市场力量时，一个众所周知的困难是平台可能实施强烈的价格偏斜，其中一些方面收取低或零价格，而其他方面则收取相对较高的价格（参见2.2.2节和2.3.1节）。因此，在考虑利润率时，应该综合考虑所有方面的整体结构。这一点可以通过之前讨论过的竞争瓶颈模型来说明。一个以广告为主要收入来源的平台可能产生很少的利润，因为它竞争激烈地吸引和留住消费者。然而，基于对竞争瓶颈的分析，并不能假设结果是有效的，并且利润消散可以使平台免受反垄断审查。

Indeed securing (on the merit) a large exclusive consumer base provides market power over advertisers. Exploitative conduct on the multi-homing side may then lead to inefficient participation levels. Moreover exclusionary conduct, such as exclusive agreements, switching costs or foreclosure, may distort competition, denying consumers some valuable options. 

确实，通过获得大规模的独家消费者群体，可以在广告商方面获得市场力量。然而，在多重归属方面的剥削行为可能导致参与水平低效。此外，排斥性行为，如独家协议、转换成本或排斥，可能扭曲竞争，限制了消费者的宝贵选择。

A consequence of the blurred relationship between margins and market power is that the evaluation of platform market power may weight relatively more non-price evidence compared to the case of one-sided competition. 

由于利润和市场力量之间的关系模糊不清，对平台市场力量的评估可能相对更多地依赖非价格证据，与单边竞争的情况相比。

A major issue is that platforms are typically offering multiple (one-sided or two-sided) services. This is because once connected to a user, a platform can leverage economies of scope to expand its activities and many aim at building a one-stop ecosystem for consumers. 22 Given that platforms with very different profiles may compete, the concept of a single product market definition or several independent markets will not fit the situation of platforms, except in rare occasions. Indeed platform competition involves a nexus of *markets,* related through heterogenous envelopment strategies (See Eisenmann et al., 
2011 ). 23 Dealing which such cases will require recognizing the interlocking between markets and the need to have a global cross-market analysis. 

一个重要问题是，平台通常提供多种（单边或双边）服务。这是因为一旦与用户连接，平台可以利用范围经济来扩大其活动，并且许多平台的目标是为消费者建立一个一站式生态系统。然而，由于具有非常不同特点的平台可能会竞争，传统的单一产品市场定义或几个独立市场的概念在平台情境下并不适用，除非在极少数情况下。实际上，平台竞争涉及一系列通过异质包围策略相互关联的*市场*（参见Eisenmann等人，2011年）。因此，在处理这些情况时需要认识到市场之间的相互联系，并进行全球跨市场分析。

When it comes to defining market and establishing market power, there is no one-fit-all solution. The policy discussion has made a distinction between transaction platforms–that intermediate direct economic transactions–
and non-transaction platforms–such as social networks. 24 
This is relevant insofar as the ability to identify/measure transactions provides platforms with richer tariff possibilities and better ability to internalize network effects. 25 
However, as discussed in Niels (2019) , the distinction is often blurred in practice and the framework of cross-side externalities applies to both types of platform. 26 
In the context of this nexus of markets, a few points emerging from the existing economic literature are worth highlighting. A first obvious point, expressed by the US 
Supreme Court in the Amex case, 27 is that any evaluation of a competition case involving a multi-sided platform should consider effects on all sides. Indeed cross-side externalities imply that actions affecting one side affect also the other side. A second point emphasized in some policy discussions (see Niels, 2019 ) is that the market definition cases of this nature. 

在定义市场和确立市场力量时，并没有一种适用于所有情况的解决方案。政策讨论将交易平台（用于中介直接经济交易）和非交易平台（如社交网络）进行了区分。这一点很重要，因为能够识别/衡量交易使得平台能够提供更多的费率选择，并更好地内部化网络效应。然而，正如Niels（2019年）所讨论的那样，在实践中这种区分常常变得模糊不清，并且跨侧外部性框架适用于两种类型的平台。在这个市场关系网络中，现有经济文献中出现了一些值得强调的观点。第一个明显的观点是由美国最高法院在Amex案件中提出的，即在涉及多边平台的竞争案件评估中，应该考虑到对所有方面产生的影响。事实上，跨侧外部性意味着影响一方也会影响另一方。第二个观点是在某些政策讨论中强调的（参见Niels, 2019年），即此类性质的市场定义案例可能存在困难。

chosen may depend on the conduct in question. 28 Moreover it may focus less on demand substitutability than for traditional markets, putting more emphasis on supply substitutability and potential competition. Identifying actual and potential competitors—more generally firms constraining or affected by the platform's activity—will require considering that differentiated business models can compete on some or all activities (free/paid, one-sided/two-sided...) A third point is that behavioral factors matter. This includes for instance single-homing/multi-homing behavior, as discussed in Section 2.3.2 , or status-quo bias. The literature also points that, when coordination failure may occur, consumer beliefs are an important determinant of market power. Not only these factors affect competition in the market but they also affect competition for the market. In particular they determine the extent of incumbency advantage ( Biglaiser and Crémer, 2020 ). Identifying the existence of a "focal" platform or of consumer inertia may help understanding the source of market power. 

市场定义的选择可能取决于所涉及的行为。此外，与传统市场相比，它可能更加注重供应替代性和潜在竞争，而不是需求替代性。确定实际和潜在竞争对手——更一般地说，受到平台活动限制或影响的公司——需要考虑到不同的商业模式可以在某些或所有活动上进行竞争（免费/付费、单边/双边等）。第三点是行为因素至关重要。这包括例如单一归属/多重归属行为（如第2.3.2节所讨论的）或者现状偏见。文献还指出，在协调失败可能发生时，消费者信念是市场力量的重要决定因素。这些因素不仅影响市场上的竞争，也影响对市场的竞争。特别是它们决定了现有优势程度（Biglaiser和Crémer, 2020）。通过确定是否存在“焦点”平台或消费者惯性，可以帮助我们理解市场力量的来源。

A more technical issue is the test to delineate relevant markets. 29 Textbook market definition is guided, at least conceptually, by the SSNIP test. Provided that a well defined two-sided market is identified, this approach can be adapted to account for feedback effects between different sides of the market and there are several ways to achieve that, depending on the assumed coordination between prices on the two sides of the market (see the discussion in Evans and Noel (2008) ; Filistrucchi (2018) ; Franck and Peitz (2019) ; Niels (2019) . 

一个更为技术性的问题是确定相关市场的测试方法。在教科书上，市场定义至少在概念上是由SSNIP测试来指导的。只要确定了一个明确定义的双边市场，就可以采用这种方法来考虑不同市场两侧之间的反馈效应，并且有几种实现方式，具体取决于假设价格在市场两侧之间的协调程度（参见Evans和Noel（2008）；Filistrucchi（2018）；Franck和Peitz（2019）；Niels（2019））。

A difficulty emerges if the service is free on one side of the market. 30 As we have seen, this arises when the platform would be willing to subsidize participation to generate externalities but cannot because this is not sustainable. Although not a conceptual issue, free goods raise the level of complexity of the analysis. First, it reveals a constraint on pricing that has ambiguous effects on the extent of barriers to entry. Second, the locus of competition for consumers shifts from prices (that are easily observable) to non-price competition, in particular quality of service and privacy policy for digital platforms. In this case, it is conceivable to use a SSNDQ test (small but significant non-transitory decrease in quality). 31 Quality of service is however complex to measure and to our knowledge, there is currently no well-established measure of quality. 32 
We conclude this section by reminding that even if one identifies market power, the question of the exercise of market power remains. Market power is a capacity, not a behavior. In most industries, the capacity to exercise market power implies exploitation of this market power as it is the sole source of profit. But platforms have multiple sources of revenue and may choose not to exploit their market power if the resulting large participation induces large profit on the other side, or at least if it is larger than the foregone profit. 

如果市场的一侧提供免费服务，就会出现一个困难。正如我们所见，这种情况发生在平台愿意通过补贴参与来产生外部性效应，但由于不可持续性而无法实现。虽然这不是一个概念问题，但免费商品增加了分析的复杂性。首先，它揭示了定价上的限制，对进入壁垒的影响具有模糊性。其次，消费者竞争的焦点从价格（容易观察到）转移到非价格竞争上，尤其是数字平台的服务质量和隐私政策。在这种情况下，可以采用SSNDQ测试（即小幅但显著且持久的质量下降）。然而，服务质量很难衡量，并且据我们所知目前没有确立良好的质量测量方法。

我们在本节中总结时要提醒大家，即使确定了市场力量也不能忽视市场力量行使问题。市场力量是一种能力而不是行为。在大多数行业中，行使市场力量的能力意味着利用这种市场力量作为唯一的利润来源。但平台有多个收入来源，并且如果结果导致另一方参与增加带来巨大利润，或者至少比放弃的利润更大，他们可能选择不行使市场力量。

## 3.2. Exclusionary *Pricing*



From the early development of models of two-sided markets, it has been claimed that below-cost pricing on one side should not raise a presumption of a predatory attempt to exclude competitors, as below-cost pricing may result from pro-competitive considerations. Notice that the issue is not new or specific to platforms as it arises in economic activities involving product complementarity, e.g. transportation, distribution or software. The literature has shown that competition may exacerbate price skewness as firms compete to attract the most valuable consumers. In what follows, we first review some relevant material from one-period models and then discuss the case of longhorizon and forward-looking firms. 

从早期的双边市场模型的发展开始，就有人声称一方的低于成本定价不应该引起排除竞争对手的敌意企图的推测，因为低于成本定价可能是由于促进竞争的考虑而产生。需要注意的是，这个问题并不新鲜，也不仅限于平台，它在涉及产品互补性的经济活动中也会出现，例如运输、分销或软件。文献表明，竞争可能加剧价格偏斜，因为企业竞相吸引最有价值的消费者。接下来，我们首先回顾一些单期模型中相关材料，并讨论长期和前瞻性企业案例。

Contributions focusing on one-period models of price competition have shown that whether or not belowcost pricing results in socially sub-optimal entry depends on the precise context. A corollary of the analysis of Caillaud and Jullien (2003) is that when there are incumbency advantage and strong network externalities, belowcost pricing may help an incumbent preserving its market from efficient entry. 33 However, the protective role of below-cost pricing is countervailed by the flexibility that divide-and-conquer strategies provide to new entrants in building market shares. Faced with a more efficient entrant, the incumbent's defensive strategy subsidizing one side is vulnerable to an entry strategy that subsidizes the other side. The cost of protecting its position on all sides of the market may be so high that the monopoly may prefer accommodating entry. By contrast with the case of pure intermediation services ( Caillaud and Jullien, 20 01, 20 03 ). Jullien, 2011 concludes in a sequential pricing game with incumbency advantage that when network externalities are not too large, there may be either excessive entry or excessive market fragmentation. In this fragmented case, potential network externality benefits are wasted. A conclusion of excessive entry accommodation is also reached by Vasconcelos (2015) in a model where an installed base of locked-in consumers on both sides of the market provides incumbency advantage. By contrast, in a sequential pricing game with fixed costs, Amelio et al. (2020) establishes the existence of consumer harmful entry deterrence for some intermediate range of entry cost. Overall, while establishing the possibility of inefficient barriers to entry, the literature is not conclusive. 

以单期价格竞争模型为基础的研究表明，低于成本定价是否导致社会上的次优进入取决于具体的背景。Caillaud和Jullien（2003）的分析推论是，在存在现有企业优势和强网络外部性的情况下，低于成本定价可能有助于现有企业保护其市场免受有效进入的影响。然而，低于成本定价所提供的分而治之策略也给新进入者在市场份额建立方面提供了灵活性，这削弱了低于成本定价的保护作用。当面对更高效率的新进入者时，现有企业通过补贴一方来进行防御策略容易受到通过补贴另一方进行进入策略攻击。在全面保护市场各个方面地位所需付出的代价可能过高，以至于垄断企业可能更愿意容纳进入。与纯粹中介服务情况相比（Caillaud和Jullien, 2001, 2003），Jullien（2011）得出结论，在具有现有企业优势的顺序定价博弈中，当网络外部性不太大时，可能存在过度进入或过度市场碎片化。在这种碎片化情况下，潜在的网络外部性效益被浪费。Vasconcelos（2015）在一个模型中得出了过度进入容纳的结论，该模型中市场两侧都有一批锁定消费者提供现有企业优势。相比之下，在具有固定成本的顺序定价博弈中，Amelio等人（2020）证明了在某个中间范围的进入成本下存在对消费者有害的进入威慑。总体而言，尽管建立了存在低效入市壁垒的可能性，但文献并未得出最终结论。

To our knowledge there are few contributions with a long-horizon perspective. Interpreting the model of Halaburda et al. (2020) (discussed in Section 2.2.1 ) as a post-entry game shows that incumbency advantage and strong network externalities may induce barriers to entry when firms are forward-looking. This article highlights the importance of consumer beliefs and self-fulfilling prophecies, but also the belief of market players as they determine their willingness to sacrifice profit. This suggests that authorities should devote special attention to dis/information strategies, communication, and marketing. 

据我们所知，很少有研究从长期的角度进行探讨。将Halaburda等人（2020年）的模型（在第2.2.1节中讨论）解释为一种后入市博弈表明，当企业具有前瞻性时，现有企业的优势和强网络外部性可能会导致进入壁垒的形成。本文强调了消费者信念和自我实现预言的重要性，同时也强调了市场参与者的信念，因为它们决定了他们愿意牺牲利润的程度。这表明当局应特别关注信息传播、沟通和营销策略。

Indeed convincing the market that a competitor will fail may suffice to induce the failure. 

确实，说服市场竞争对手会失败可能足以导致其失败。

Standard theories of predation apply to platforms as well as to any other firm (see Bolton et al., 1999 , for a review and discussion). As building network externalities and reaching a critical mass may be costly and long, an entrant would need to secure enough financial support to sustain the loss incurred in the first stage of entry. Theories of financial predation under asymmetric information (see Bolton and Scharfstein, 1990 ) may thus be relevant. A platform could also credibly develop a reputation of aggressiveness toward entrants or try to manipulate market signals. 34 
One debated issue is the relevant test for predation. The actual approach to predation relies on a combination of sacrifice test and recoupment test. 35 Following the Areeda- 
Turner rule, the most common way to establish a sacrifice is to compare actual prices with average costs or with average variable costs (as a proxy for marginal costs). As for market power, price-skewness challenges this approach. A test at the two-sided market level is possible but may generate false negatives. An alternative is to conduct a test on each side, building on the pricing formulas discussed in the Section 2.3.1 . Indeed prices follow a standard markup formula but where the costs must be adjusted for any opportunity cost. Hence, the relevant "marginal cost" on one side is equal to the cost net of any revenue that a customer on one side allows the platform to generate on the other side. Defining the relevant marginal cost this way would provide a partial competitive benchmark for efficient pricing on each side. Based on this insight, Berhinger and Filistrucchi (2015) propose and discuss an extension of the Areeda-Turner rule that has two novel features. First, given that the market involves two sides and two prices, there are two tests, one for each side. Second, each test accounts for the margin on the other side of the market and crossside demand externalities. 36 

平台和其他公司一样，标准的掠夺理论同样适用于平台（参见Bolton等人，1999年的综述和讨论）。由于建立网络外部性和达到临界质量可能是昂贵且漫长的过程，新进入者需要获得足够的财务支持来承担进入第一阶段所产生的损失。关于信息不对称下金融掠夺的理论（参见Bolton和Scharfstein，1990年）可能是相关的。平台还可以可信地发展出对待新进入者具有攻击性的声誉或试图操纵市场信号。

一个争议中存在着关于掠夺测试方法的问题。实际上，掠夺方法依赖于牺牲测试和收回测试相结合。根据Areeda-Turner规则，建立牺牲通常是通过将实际价格与平均成本或平均变动成本进行比较（作为边际成本主体）来完成。至于市场力量，价格偏斜挑战了这种方法。在双边市场层面进行测试是可能的，但可能会产生错误判断。另一种选择是在每一方面进行测试，并基于第2.3.1节中讨论过的定价公式进行构建。实际上，价格遵循标准的加价公式，但成本必须根据任何机会成本进行调整。因此，这种方式定义的相关“边际成本”等于减去一方面的客户允许平台在另一方面产生的任何收入后的成本。以这种方式定义相关边际成本将为每一方面的有效定价提供部分竞争基准。基于这一观点，Berhinger和Filistrucchi（2015年）提出并讨论了Areeda-Turner规则的扩展，具有两个新特点。首先，由于市场涉及两个方面和两个价格，因此有两个测试，每个方面一个测试。其次，每个测试都考虑到市场另一侧和跨侧需求外部性上的利润。

## 3.3. *Exclusivity*



Armstrong and Wright (2007) were the first to point to the possibility that two-sided platforms use exclusive dealing as a way to prevent multi-homing. 37 Preventing multihoming is unilaterally profitable because multi-homing on one side of the market reduces the revenue that a platform can obtain on the other side of the market. They analyze several models and show that the possibility of offering exclusive contracts destabilizes equilibria where agents multi-home on one side. In a model of competitive bottleneck—where profit is dissipated through competition for single-homers—they show that by offering exclusive contracts on the multi-homing side, one platform can monopolize the market. The resulting equilibrium then involves tipping and lower consumer surplus than without exclusive contracts. 

Armstrong和Wright（2007年）最早指出，双边平台可能使用排他性交易来阻止多重归属。阻止多重归属在单方面是有利可图的，因为在市场的一侧进行多重归属会降低平台在另一侧获得的收入。他们通过分析多个模型表明，提供排他性合同的可能性会破坏主体在一侧进行多重归属的均衡状态。在竞争瓶颈模型中，即通过与多重归属方面签订排他性合同，一个平台可以垄断市场。由此产生的均衡涉及倾斜，并且消费者剩余比没有排他性合同时更低。

Carroni et al. (2019) further develop the analysis of exclusivity by noticing that exclusivity of an agent generating large externality (a superstar) helps convincing other agents on the same side (say sellers) to stop multi-homing and to join the platform exclusively. This is because, exclusivity of the superstar shifts demand on the other side of the market (consumers) toward the superstar's platform. 

Carroni等人（2019年）进一步深化了对排他性的分析，他们观察到，一个产生巨大外部性的主体（即超级明星）的排他性有助于说服同一方面的其他主体（例如卖家）停止在多个平台上活动，并选择独家加入该平台。这是因为超级明星的排他性将市场另一方面（即消费者）的需求转向了超级明星所在的平台。

Multi-homing then becomes less attractive for sellers (the incremental value of the competing platform decreases) and more sellers single-home along the superstar, which induces a virtuous participation circle through the twosided feedback loop. However, gaining exclusivity requires costly compensation of the superstar for lost interactions on the competing platform. Carroni et al. (2019) conclude that exclusivity will emerge if the intensity of competition is strong on the consumer side and that this may benefit small sellers and consumers because seller participation increases and larger network externalities are generated. Thus, even if exclusivity may lead to tipping, it will not necessarily reduce social welfare. 

在多主体系统中，卖家对于多平台同时运营的吸引力减弱（竞争平台的附加价值减少），因此更多卖家选择在超级明星所在的平台上进行独家经营，从而通过双边反馈循环形成良性参与循环。然而，获得排他性需要对超级明星进行昂贵的补偿，以弥补在竞争平台上失去的互动。Carroni等人（2019年）得出结论：如果消费者一方的竞争强度较高，则排他性将会出现，并且这可能对小型卖家和消费者有利，因为卖家参与度增加，并产生更大的网络外部性。因此，即使排他性可能导致转折点出现，但不一定会降低社会福利。

[参考原文，对上述中文译文进行重写:]

In these two contributions, exclusivity is a tool to gain competitive hedge at the cost of reduced overall externalities between sides. Along this line, an empirical investigation of the video game industry between 20 0 0 and 20 05 by Lee (2013) has shown that exclusivity of software significantly reduced demand for both hardware and software. 

在这两个案例中，排他性是一种以减少双方整体外部性为代价来获得竞争优势的工具。沿着这一思路，李（2013年）对2000年至2005年间的视频游戏行业进行了实证研究，结果显示软件的排他性显著降低了对硬件和软件的需求。

Another concern with exclusive contracts is that they may protect a dominant position. In particular, it is well known that exclusive dealing may be used to raise barriers to entry when there are increasing returns to scale within the market (see Rasmusen et al., 1991; Segal and Whinston, 20 0 0 ) or across markets ( Bernheim and Whinston, 1998 ). Given the similarity between network externalities and returns to scale, the same should occur in platform competition. Doganoglu and Wright (2010) confirm this insight. They assume that an incumbent can make introductory offers to a subpopulation of consumers before price competition with an entrant. Absent exclusive dealing, introductory offers are inefficient at protecting the incumbent against an efficient entrant because the targets of introductory offers can multi-home afterward and will do so if other consumers buy only the entrant's product. Exclusive introductory offers allow the incumbent to secure the exclusive participation of a critical mass of users and to gain a competitive advantage as other consumers seek the network externality induced by the exclusive consumers. In this case all users buy the incumbent platform's product and the entrant must contend with inducing multi-homing with a low price for the incremental benefit of higher quality. As a result, entry is impeded and occurs at a suboptimal scale. 

排他性合同还存在另一个问题，即可能保护垄断地位。特别是众所周知，当市场内存在规模收益递增时（参见Rasmusen等人，1991年；Segal和Whinston，2000年），或者跨市场时（Bernheim和Whinston，1998年），排他性交易可能被用来提高进入壁垒。鉴于网络外部性与规模收益的相似性，平台竞争中也应该出现类似情况。Doganoglu和Wright（2010年）证实了这一观点。他们假设现有企业可以在与新进入者进行价格竞争之前向某一部分消费者提供引入优惠。如果没有排他性交易，引入优惠对于保护现有企业免受高效新进入者的影响是低效的，因为引入优惠的目标消费者之后可以选择多个平台，并且如果其他消费者只购买新进入者的产品，则会这样做。而排他性引入优惠使得现有企业能够确保关键用户群体的独家参与，并获得其他消费者寻求由独家消费者带来的网络外部性所带来的竞争优势。在这种情况下，所有用户都购买现有企业的产品，新进入者必须通过以较低的价格获得更高质量的增量效益来诱使用户同时使用多个平台。结果，进入市场受到阻碍，并且以次优规模发生。

As pointed out by Evans (2013) , the other side of the coin is that exclusivity may help an entrant improving coordination on its efficient platform. 38 A recent study by Markovich and Yehezkel (2019) further investigates this question in the presence of a user-group, i.e., an institution coordinating the choices of a group of users (such as a cooperative, an investment fund or a bank adopting a credit card). In their model, firms bid for the user-group before competing for other users. But due to an incumbency advantage, a new entrant faces difficulty in coordinating the consumers on its platform. Introductory offers to the user-group facilitate entry if participation of this group induces a bandwagon effect that attracts other noncoordinated users. However, when the group chooses to multi-home (hence under non-exclusivity), the bandwagon effect vanishes and it is difficult for the entrant to overcome the incumbency advantage. By contrast, gaining the exclusive participation of the user-group may allow the entrant to win competition for the rest of the market. However, while exclusive offers facilitate entry, barriers to entry still exist as the incumbent may subsidize the user-group to preserve its monopoly position. 

正如Evans（2013年）所指出的，排他性可能有助于新进入者在其高效平台上改善协调。最近，Markovich和Yehezkel（2019年）在用户群存在的情况下进一步研究了这个问题，即一个机构协调一组用户的选择（例如合作社、投资基金或采用信用卡的银行）。在他们的模型中，企业在竞争其他用户之前为用户群进行竞标。然而，由于现有企业的优势地位，新进入者很难在其平台上协调消费者。向用户群提供引入优惠可以促进市场准入，如果该群体的参与引发了其他非协调用户的跟风效应。然而，当该群体选择多平台使用时（因此不具排他性），跟风效应消失了，并且新进入者很难克服现有企业的优势地位。相比之下，获得用户群独家参与可能使新进入者赢得市场上其他部分的竞争。然而，在排他性优惠促进了市场准入之际，仍然存在准入壁垒，因为现有企业可能会对用户群进行补贴以保持其垄断地位。

One reading of the literature on exclusivity is that it can help a platform monopolizing a market or protecting its dominant position. To this respect exclusivity by dominant platforms may deserve special scrutiny when network effects are lar ge. Unlike incumbents, new entrants in platform markets need to overcome coordination issues due to network externalities, which is facilitated by exclusive offers. This suggests an asymmetric treatment of exclusivity, although one should be aware of the risk of excessive entry. 

对排他性的文献研究有一种观点认为，它可以帮助平台垄断市场或保护其主导地位。在网络效应较大的情况下，占主导地位的平台通过采取排他性措施可能需要受到特别关注。与现有企业不同，进入平台市场的新参与者需要克服由网络外部性引起的协调问题，而排他性优惠可以促进这一过程。这表明，在处理排他性问题时应采取不对称的态度，尽管应注意过度准入的风险存在。

When there is competition on the market between non-dominant platforms, exclusivity may be a way for a competitive platform to improve its position rather than to exclude a competitor. In this context, as shown by Belleflamme and Peitz (2019) , multi-homing (and its counterpart exclusivity) may benefit either side of the market and it is difficult to say whether it improves or harms welfare. 

在非主导平台之间存在市场竞争时，排他性可能成为一种竞争平台改善其地位的方式，而非排除竞争对手。正如Belleflamme和Peitz（2019）所指出的那样，在这种情况下，多重归属（以及其对应的排他性）可能对市场的双方都有益处，很难确定它是改善还是损害福利。

## 3.4. *Bundling*



Bundling is a common and well-known phenomenon on the internet. The prominence of bundling in information services relates in part to the fact that these services incur very small variable costs. 39 As platforms benefit from economies of scale and economies of scope, there is very little cost in using a platform to offer a service to all the population rather than a targeted sub-population. In this context, it may be more profitable to offer all the services in a bundle with a single total price, rather than setting a price per service and letting customers choose which services they want. Traditional economic analysis identifies price discrimination and exclusion as two motives for bundling (see Fumagalli and Motta, 2018 ). This applies to platforms but there are also some specificities that we now discuss. 

互联网上的捆绑销售是一种常见且广为人知的现象。信息服务领域中捆绑销售的突出地位部分归因于这些服务所产生的可变成本非常低。由于平台可以从规模经济和范围经济中获益，因此使用平台向整个人口提供服务而不是针对特定子群体提供服务几乎没有成本。在这种情况下，将所有服务以单一总价的形式打包销售可能比设定每项服务的价格并让客户选择更具利润性。传统经济分析确定了价格歧视和排除作为捆绑销售的两个动机（参见Fumagalli和Motta，2018年）。尽管这些动机同样适用于平台，但也存在一些我们现在要讨论的特殊情况。

We start with a contribution related to discrimination, in that bundling allows platforms to change the prices faced by different types of users. Amelio and Jullien (2012) point to the fact that a motive for bundling is to raise the value for consumers on a free side of the market. In their model, adding an additional service to a free service is akin to setting a negative price when a monetary subsidy to consumers is not feasible for practical reasons (either technical or because of consumers' opportunism). This is thus a way to boost demand on one side and it is optimal when the increased participation raises the network externality on the other side of the market, hence the revenue. Amelio and Jullien (2012) identify conditions for a monopoly and a symmetric duopoly to set a zero price on one side and investigate the consequences of allowing a platform to bundle the service with another good on one side. They show that bundling by a monopoly platform is pro-competitive as consumers on the free side benefit from higher utility of the bundle while consumers on the other side benefit from higher externality. In a competitive context, the analysis of bundling is more complex because attracting a pay consumer becomes costlier to the platform, as the two-sided network feedback raises the loss on the subsidized side. Bundling is thus a costly way to raise demand on both sides and the higher cost results in less pricing aggressiveness on the pay side. Bundling by two competing platforms reduces total consumer welfare because the demand-shifting effects cancel each other while prices increase on the pay side. When only one platform can do it, bundling may not be profitable if the competing platform is too aggressive in preserving its market share, and it may hurt or benefit the competing platforms due to competition softening. Their general conclusion is that bundling "raises total welfare [in] situations with large externalities and strong competition". 

我们首先讨论与歧视有关的贡献，即捆绑销售使平台能够改变不同类型用户所面临的价格。Amelio和Jullien（2012）指出，捆绑销售的一个动机是提高市场上免费一侧对消费者的价值。在他们的模型中，将额外服务添加到免费服务中类似于在实际原因（技术或消费者机会主义）不可行时设置负价格（无法向消费者提供货币补贴）。这是一种提高需求的方式，并且当增加参与度提高市场另一侧网络外部性时，这种方式是最优选择，从而增加收入。Amelio和Jullien（2012）确定了垄断和对称垄断设置一侧零价格并调查允许平台将服务与另一种商品捆绑在一起的条件。他们表明，垄断平台进行捆绑销售是争取竞争优势的，因为免费一侧的消费者从打包套餐获得更高效用，而另一侧消费者则从更高外部性中受益。在竞争环境下，捆绑销售分析更加复杂，因为吸引付费用户对平台来说变得更加昂贵，因为双边网络反馈会增加补贴一侧的损失。因此，捆绑销售是一种提高两侧需求的代价高昂的方式，并且更高的成本导致付费一侧定价策略不够激进。两个竞争平台进行捆绑销售会降低总体消费者福利，因为需求转移效应相互抵消，而付费一侧价格上升。当只有一个平台可以这样做时，如果竞争对手平台在保持市场份额方面过于激进，则捆绑销售可能不具有盈利性，并且由于竞争减弱而可能对竞争对手产生伤害或利益。他们的总体结论是，“在具有大外部性和激烈竞争的情况下，捆绑销售“提高了总体福利”。

Choi and Jeon (2020) further clarify the interaction between bundling and non-negative price constraint by considering a monopoly that ties its good with in a free, adfinanced service. Their key point is that because the tying service is free, a competitor already constrained by nonnegativity of prices cannot react aggressively. According to the same logic as Amelio and Jullien (2012) , the monopoly is able to sacrifice profit from the monopoly good to capture the advertising revenue of the free service. This provides the monopoly with an advantage allowing it to win competition to sell the ad-financed service when faced with a more efficient competitor. 

通过考虑将商品与免费广告资助服务捆绑在一起的垄断情况，Choi和Jeon（2020）进一步阐明了捆绑销售和非负价格约束之间的相互作用。他们的关键观点是，由于捆绑服务是免费的，已经受到非负价格约束限制的竞争对手无法采取激进措施。根据Amelio和Jullien（2012）的相同逻辑，垄断者可以牺牲垄断商品的利润来获取免费服务的广告收入。这使得垄断者在面对更高效率竞争对手时具有优势，并能够赢得销售广告资助服务的竞争。

While the previous analysis of bundling focused on independent goods, Choi (2010) highlights an exclusionary motive for tying a two-sided service with a monopoly product that is essential to the service–e.g., a media-player with the operating system. In this context, a well-known argument from the Chicago School is that a monopoly has no incentive to exclude rivals in the complementary segment because it can reap all profit through the price of the monopoly product. Choi (2010) argues that this logic does not apply if the complementary segment is two-sided and only one side buys the monopoly product. 40 The intuition is that the monopoly cannot capture the surplus created on the complementary segment for the side not buying the monopoly product. In Choi's model, the complementary service, proposed by the monopoly and a competing independent platform, allows content producers to access consumers. Absent tying, some consumers and some producers multi-home. Following the "incremental pricing principle", the presence of multi-homing consumers reduces the price that can be charged to multi-homing producers and the total profit of the platform. Tying the service is a way for the monopoly to break this logic by forcing all consumers to have the firm's two-sided service. This helps convincing producers to single-home on the monopoly two-sided service. By reducing the volume of content on the independent platform, this induces also more consumers to single-home, allowing the firm to raise the price to producers. While the paper shows a rationale for exclusionary bundling, it also concludes that absent distributive concerns and long-term considerations, bundling is socially desirable when it is profitable, as it gives consumers access to more content. 

尽管以前对于捆绑销售的分析主要集中在独立商品上，但Choi（2010）强调了将垄断产品与服务的关键部分捆绑在一起时的排斥动机，例如将媒体播放器与操作系统捆绑在一起。在这种情况下，芝加哥学派提出了一个众所周知的论点，即垄断者没有排斥竞争对手进入互补领域的动机，因为它可以通过垄断产品的价格获得所有利润。然而，Choi（2010）认为这种逻辑不适用于双边市场中只有一方购买垄断产品的情况。他指出，在这种情况下，垄断者无法从未购买垄断产品的那一方获得互补领域所创造的剩余价值。在Choi提出的模型中，垄断者和竞争独立平台提供了互补服务，使内容生产者能够接触到消费者。如果没有捆绑销售，一些消费者和生产者会选择多个平台。根据“增量定价原则”，多个平台使用者降低了平台可以向多个平台使用者收取费用以及总利润。因此，垄断者通过捆绑销售来打破这种逻辑，强制所有消费者使用其双边服务。这有助于说服生产者只选择垄断的双边服务。通过减少独立平台上的内容量，这也会促使更多消费者只选择垄断服务，从而使垄断者能够提高对生产者的价格。尽管该论文展示了排斥性捆绑销售的合理性，但同时也得出结论，在没有分配关注和长期考虑因素时，当捆绑销售具有盈利能力时，它是社会可取的，因为它使消费者可以获得更多内容访问权。

De Cornière and Taylor (2019) analyze pure bundling by powerful complementors of a platform. They consider a platform and some sellers of ad-financed complementary goods that can be provided by the platform to its consumers (e.g. mobile applications and smartphones). Sellers negotiate a profit-sharing contract to access the platform. In this context, they assume that one seller owns two applications, the first having no substitute and the second having substitutes offered by other sellers. The seller is powerful in the sense that consumer participation to the platform is drastically reduced if the first application is not available on the platform. They show that bundling its two applications allows the powerful seller to obtain better access conditions to the platform. This occurs because the competing seller of the second application becomes less aggressive. Indeed with independent negotiations for each application, the size of the platform (hence the ad revenue from the second application) is not affected by the identity of the provider of the second application, which puts all sellers on equal footing. But bundling forces a single negotiation where the bundle competes with the second applications of other providers. The size of the platform is reduced if the powerful seller looses this competition because the first application is not available, which reduces also the ad-revenue of a winning independent provider compared to the unbundled case. 41 In this argument, bundling shifts profit from the platform to the monopoly application seller. 

De Cornière和Taylor（2019）对平台的强大补充者进行了纯捆绑销售的分析。他们研究了一个平台和一些通过该平台向消费者提供广告资助的互补商品的卖家（例如移动应用程序和智能手机）。卖家们通过谈判利润分享合同来获得进入平台的权限。在这种情况下，他们假设一个卖家拥有两个应用程序，第一个应用程序没有替代品，而第二个应用程序有其他卖家提供的替代品。如果第一个应用程序在平台上不可用，那么消费者参与该平台将大幅减少，这使得该卖家具有强大的地位。他们表明，捆绑销售两个应用程序使得强大的卖家能够获得更好的进入条件。这是因为竞争对手销售第二个应用程序变得不那么激进。实际上，在每个应用程序独立谈判时，平台规模（因此来自第二个应用程序的广告收入）不受第二个应用程序提供者身份影响，这使所有卖家处于同等地位。但是捆绑销售会强制进行单一谈判，在此谈判中，捆绑销售与其他提供者的第二个应用程序竞争。如果强大的卖家在这场竞争中失败，平台规模将减小，因为第一个应用程序不可用，这也会降低独立提供者相对于未捆绑情况下的广告收入。在这种论证中，捆绑销售将利润从平台转移到垄断应用程序卖家那里。

Disentangling pro and anti-competitive effects of bundling in platform competition is a challenging task. The new insights of the economic literature on platforms are twofold. On one hand, it points to circumstances where bundling raises efficiency by improving coordination of consumers. Arguing that this is the case will require demonstrating significant coordination failures and the necessity of bundling. On the other hand, it also shows that the practice raises new concerns that are specific to markets with platforms and that it should be the object of special scrutiny to prevent anti-competitive leverage of market power across markets. The literature pointed that the lack of price competition in ad-financed activity creates opportunities for such leverage. Participation externality across products may create other leverage opportunities. 

在平台竞争中，解开捆绑销售的促进竞争和反竞争效应是一项具有挑战性的任务。经济学文献对平台的新见解有两个方面。一方面，它指出，在某些情况下，捆绑销售通过改善消费者协调来提高效率。要论证这种情况，需要证明存在重大的协调失灵，并且捆绑销售是必要的。另一方面，它还显示出这种做法引发了与平台市场特定相关的新问题，并且应该接受特别审查，以防止市场力量在不同市场上产生反竞争杠杆作用。文献指出，在广告资助活动中缺乏价格竞争为此类杠杆创造了机会。产品间的参与外部性可能会产生其他杠杆机会。

## 3.5. Vertical Integration And Vertical *Foreclosure*



Vertical integration is quite common for platforms which provide some complementary services in-house and rely on third parties for others. Vertical integration by platforms may have several efficiency motivations. In particular, as in any vertical supply chain, it may raise volumes by eliminating "double marginalization". Moreover, it may facilitate investment and foster transfer of knowledge to the integrated branch. In the case of platforms, it has some additional benefits because it leads to better internalization of network externalities. For instance, direct sales by Amazon guarantee consumers a minimal and reliable supply of good-quality products while the marketplace raises the value of the platform by increasing diversity and the number of products. 

对于提供一些内部互补服务并依赖第三方提供其他服务的平台来说，垂直整合是相当常见的。平台进行垂直整合可能有几个效率动机。特别是，与任何垂直供应链一样，通过消除“双重边际化”，它可以提高销售量。此外，它还可以促进投资并促进知识传递到整合部门。对于平台而言，它还具有一些额外的好处，因为它能更好地内部化网络外部性。例如，亚马逊通过直接销售保证消费者获得最低和可靠的优质产品供应，而市场则通过增加多样性和产品数量来提高平台的价值。

By integrating some supply from side-2, a platform can credibly convince side-1 consumers that they will be able to trade on the platform. This may help platforms to overcome the "chicken & egg" problem when platforms face unfavorable consumer beliefs. This issue is discussed by Hagiu and Spulber (2013) in the context of a platform intermediating trade between content suppliers and buyers. As we have seen when buyers and sellers are potentially interested but skeptical about the success of a platform, this platform must develop a costly subsidization strategy through divide-and-conquer strategies. Then it may offer some integrated content to appear more attractive and reduce the subsidization cost. Assuming that integrated content boosts buyers' participation but impedes sellers' profit per buyer, Hagiu and Spulber (2013) show that offering integrated content is profitable whenever the platform subsidizes buyer's participation and generates profit on the sellers' side. The reverse holds if the platform subsidizes sellers' participation, as adding integrated content would raise the direct subsidy required to attract sellers. An intuitive conclusion they derive is that when buyers are singlehoming, competition for buyers leads to a larger provision of integrated content. Insofar as the chicken & egg problem concerns non-established platforms, this analysis should only apply to non-dominant platforms. 

通过整合来自第二方的供应，平台可以可靠地说服第一方消费者他们将能够在平台上进行交易。这种策略有助于平台克服面临不利消费者信念时的“鸡生蛋”问题。Hagiu和Spulber（2013）在一个平台在内容供应商和买家之间进行交易中介时讨论了这个问题。当买家和卖家可能对平台的成功持怀疑态度时，该平台必须采取昂贵的分而治之策略来发展补贴策略。然后，它可以提供一些整合内容以增加吸引力并降低补贴成本。假设整合内容提高了买家参与度但降低了卖家每位买家的利润，Hagiu和Spulber（2013）证明，在平台补贴买家参与并在卖方获利时，提供整合内容是有盈利性的。如果平台补贴卖方参与，则情况相反，因为添加整合内容将增加吸引卖方所需的直接补贴。他们得出一个直观结论是，当买家只选择一个平台时，对于买家竞争会导致更多的整合内容提供。就鸡生蛋问题而言，这个分析只适用于非主导平台。

While vertical integration in complementary services by platforms may improve coordination, it also raises the issue of the foreclosure of competing third-party suppliers of complementary services. To illustrate this, Miao (2009) considers a monopoly seller of a platform good vertically integrated in a competitive complementary segment providing applications that allow third parties to interact with platform members. If the platform could charge third parties directly for accessing its customers, it would benefit from having a competitive complementary segment as this would maximize the value of its own service on both sides of the market. However, if the sole sources of revenue are the revenues from the sales of the platform good and the sales of the complementary application, the platform may have an incentive to monopolize the complementary segment by making its platform incompatible with other suppliers of the application. The reason is that competition on the complementary segment dissipates profit to the benefit of third parties. 42 Incompatibility with non-integrated complementary applications then allows the platform to monopolize the complementary segment and extract some rent from third parties. This can be achieved by denying access to complementors but also by degrading interoperability or software integration, which would prevent level playing field competition. 

尽管平台通过在互补服务方面进行垂直整合可以提高协调性，但也引发了竞争第三方互补服务供应商被排除的问题。为了阐明这一点，Miao（2009）考虑了一个垄断销售平台商品并在竞争性互补领域进行垂直整合的案例，该平台提供应用程序，允许第三方与平台成员进行交互。如果平台能够直接向第三方收费以访问其客户，那么拥有竞争性的互补领域将最大化其自身服务在市场两侧的价值。然而，如果唯一的收入来源是来自平台商品销售和互补应用程序销售的收入，那么平台可能会有动机通过使其与其他应用程序供应商不兼容来垄断互补领域。原因在于竞争会削弱利润，从而使第三方受益。42与非整合型互补应用程序不兼容，则允许平台垄断互补领域并从第三方那里获取一定租金。这可以通过拒绝给与者提供接入权限来实现，也可以通过降低相容性或软件集成来阻止公平竞争。

De Cornière and Taylor (2014) provide a similar argument in the case of a search engine, based on the issue of appropriation of advertising revenue. They consider a search engine that guides the choice of consumers between several content publishers. Both the search engine and the publishers are solely ad-financed. In this context, the best choice of publisher for the consumer depends on the match quality of content and the nuisance from advertising that consumers will have to bear. When the search engine vertically integrates with a publisher, it tends to bias the search result in favor of this subsidiary to benefit from its advertising revenue. 43 However, they show that there are two countervailing effects. First, as the total advertising revenue per consumer includes advertising revenue from both the search engine and the subsidiary publisher, the integrated firm has more incentives to boost total demand by providing high-quality advices for consumers. Second, the subsidiary internalizes the fact that higher utility from its content benefits the search engine and reduces its volume of advertising. Consequently, the effect of vertical integration on total welfare is ambiguous. 

De Cornière和Taylor（2014）在搜索引擎的情况下提出了类似的论点，该论点基于广告收入挪用的问题。他们考虑了一个引导消费者在多个内容发布者之间进行选择的搜索引擎。搜索引擎和发布者都是仅由广告资助的。在这种情境下，消费者对于选择最佳发布者来说，取决于内容匹配质量以及消费者需要承担的广告干扰程度。当搜索引擎与一个发布者进行垂直整合时，它倾向于偏向这个子公司以从其广告收入中获益。然而，他们表明存在两种相互抵消的效应。首先，由于每位消费者的总广告收入包括来自搜索引擎和子公司发布者的广告收入，整合企业有更多动机通过为消费者提供高质量建议来推动总需求。其次，子公司内部化了从其内容中获得更高效用对搜索引擎有益并减少其广告量的事实。因此，垂直整合对总体福利的影响是不确定的。

Due to the nature of their activity, platforms have many opportunities and ways to foreclose. The issue is therefore worthy of scrutiny by anti-trust authorities. It is particularly acute when foreclosure shifts third-party revenues which cannot be appropriated otherwise - such as advertising revenue or innovation rents - toward the platform's affiliate. However, as already mentioned, a platform may have the ability but not the incentives to foreclose. 

由于平台活动的特性，它们有许多机会和方式来进行排斥。因此，反垄断当局对此问题进行审查是非常必要的。尤其是当排斥行为将无法以其他方式获取的第三方收入（如广告收入或创新租金）转移到平台的关联公司时，问题就变得尤为严重。然而，正如前面提到的，平台可能具备排斥的能力，但却没有相应的激励去实施排斥行为。

Here, the platform faces a trade-off between maximizing its long-run value, which requires a consumer-value orientation aimed at improving consumers' loyalty, and generating short-run profits through its subsidiary. 

在这里，平台面临着一个权衡，即追求最大化长期价值的消费者价值导向，旨在提高消费者忠诚度，以及通过其子公司实现短期利润。

## 3.6. *Collusion*



Despite the existence of several cases of collusion between two-sided platforms, in particular in the media in- 
42 This assumes that the monopoly i) cannot extract third-parties rent by charging consumers for interacting with them (as may be the case with a monetary exchange between sides) and ii) cannot charge competitors a variable fee for compatibility. 

尽管存在一些双边平台之间的勾结案例，特别是在媒体领域中（42）。这种情况下，我们假设垄断者无法通过向消费者收取与他们互动的费用来提取第三方租金（例如在两个方面之间进行货币交换的情况），也无法向竞争对手收取可变费用以实现兼容性。

43 This reasoning assumes that the search engine cannot charge a listing fee to other publishers (results are organic). 

这种推理假设搜索引擎无法向其他发布者收取刊登费用（结果是有机的）。

dustry, 44 there is little work on collusion between platforms. Among platforms, collusion may occur on all prices but sometime only on prices on one side. For instance, some cases involved newspapers colluding on cover prices but still competing on the advertising side. 45 Thus, understanding collusion requires examining both possibilities. The key question is to know how platforms achieve collusion in the two cases and what are the resulting implications for consumers on the two sides. From the analysis of competitive and monopoly pricing, we know that a monopoly would not always set prices higher than competitive prices on both sides of the market. Following this insight, Dewenter et al. (2011) argue that colluding on one side may reduce prices on the other side, in which case collusion may benefit some users. An extensive treatment of this question in the Armstrong model is made by Lefouili and Pinho, 2020 . They first show that when all consumers single-home, the highest sustainable collusive profit is achieved with supra-competitive prices for both sides of the market if platforms are sufficiently differentiated on each side. If in addition sides differ in the substitutability between platforms, the result doesn't hold and the price may decrease on the side with the least differentiation. But the collusive price may be below competitive level on a side where differentiation is small (relative to network externalities). Things are even more complex when either some consumers multi-home or collusion occurs on one side only. 

在平台之间的勾结方面，对于平台之间的勾结研究相对较少，尤其是在媒体领域（42）。平台之间的勾结可能发生在所有价格上，但有时仅限于一方的价格。例如，有些案例涉及报纸在售价上进行勾结，但在广告方面仍存在竞争（45）。因此，要理解勾结现象，需要同时考虑这两种可能性。关键问题是了解平台如何在这两种情况下实现勾结，并且这对市场两个方面的消费者产生了怎样的影响。根据竞争定价和垄断定价的分析结果，我们知道垄断者并不总是会将价格设置得比市场上竞争价格更高。基于这一观点，Dewenter等人（2011）认为，在一方进行勾结时可能会降低另一方的价格，在这种情况下，勾结可能对某些用户有利。Lefouili和Pinho（2020）在Armstrong模型中对这个问题进行了详细讨论。他们首先指出，在所有消费者都只选择一个平台时，如果平台在每个方面都具有足够的差异化程度，则可以通过超竞争性定价来实现最大可持续的合谋利润。此外，如果平台之间的两个方面在替代程度上存在差异，那么这个结果就不成立，并且价格可能会在差异较小的一方降低。然而，当一些消费者选择多个平台或者只有一方发生勾结时，情况变得更加复杂。

To see that, suppose first that users multi-home on one side and single-home on the other side. One may think of sellers being active on several platforms while consumers focus only on one, or advertisers buying space in several newspapers while consumers read only one newspaper. Recall that in this case, platforms compete to attract the single-homing side (the consumers) and charge the other side to access them. As the populations of consumers on each platform are distinct, each platform charges a "monopoly" price for access to its consumers. Hence, absent collusion, multi-homers already face monopoly prices (for given demand on the other side). As a consequence, collusion has no direct effect on this side, unless it affects consumer participation. By contrast, collusion would raise prices on the single-homing side. 

为了理解这一点，首先假设用户在一方选择多个平台，而在另一方只选择一个平台。可以想象卖家在多个平台上活跃，而消费者只关注一个平台，或者广告商在多家报纸上购买广告空间，而消费者只阅读一家报纸。回想一下，在这种情况下，各个平台竞争吸引单一居住方（即消费者），并向另一方收取访问费用。由于每个平台的消费者群体是不同的，每个平台都对其消费者的访问收取“垄断”价格。因此，在没有勾结的情况下，多主体已经面临垄断价格（对于给定的另一方需求）。因此，除非勾结影响到消费者参与度，否则勾结对这一方没有直接影响。相比之下，勾结会提高单居住方的价格。

Suppose now that all users single-home but collusion occurs only on one side. 46 Lefouili and Pinho, 2020 show that there is a subtle relation between prices, that reflects 
44 For example Citizen Publishing Co. vs. United States, 394 U.S. 131

假设现在所有用户都只选择一个平台，但勾结只发生在一方。Lefouili和Pinho（2020）指出，价格之间存在微妙的关系，这反映了...例如Citizen Publishing Co. vs. United States, 394 U.S. 131（1969）这个案例是关于日报的。Ruhmer（2010）提到了德国电视或报纸市场的几个案例。Lefouili和Pinho（2020）还提到了涉及委内瑞拉1996年、巴西2005年、克罗地亚2010年、匈牙利2014年和黑山2014年的报纸案例。非媒体案例包括COMP/E-2/37.784（2002）涉及拍卖行，以及AdC Décision n◦19-D-25（2019）关于餐厅券市场。

46 For instance, the prices may be set by different agents on both sides, only those on one side colluding while others set prices to maximize the short-run firm profit. 

例如，价格可能由双方的不同主体设定，只有一方的主体勾结，而其他主体则设定价格以最大化短期企业利润。

the dual nature of consumers on platforms: the consumer is paying for the good but is also a source of revenue (an input) on the other side of the market. If the firms set the collusive price above the competitive level, then the margin for new sales generated on this side increases and this intensifies competition on the other (non-collusive) side, because attracting these consumers is a way to raise sales on the colluding side. Anticipating that, colluding firms may decide to reduce the collusive price below the competitive level in order to relax competition on the competitive side of the market. This occurs when the externality generated by agents of the non-collusive side is large, such that competition is intense. By contrast, if agents on the non-collusive side generate a negative externality (say, advertisers generating a nuisance on readers), then all prices increase when collusion emerges. 

平台上消费者的双重性质：消费者既支付商品的价格，同时也是市场另一侧的收入来源（一种投入）。如果企业将勾结价格设定在竞争水平之上，那么在这一侧产生的新销售利润空间增加，从而加剧了另一侧（非勾结）的竞争，因为吸引这些消费者是提高勾结方销售额的一种方式。预见到这一点，勾结企业可能决定将勾结价格降低到竞争水平以下，以放松市场竞争。当非勾结方主体所产生的外部性很大时（例如广告商对读者造成骚扰），则当出现勾结时所有价格都会增加。

To summarize, despite a general presumption is that collusion would lead to higher prices and lower consumer surplus, there may be situations where consumers on one side benefit from lower prices when firms collude. In particular, some consumers may gain when collusion only occurs on one side, whether it is on their side or the opposite. These general conclusions apply to tacit collusion as well as to cartels. 

总结而言，尽管普遍认为勾结会导致价格上涨和消费者剩余减少，但在某些情况下，当企业发生勾结时，一方的消费者可能从更低的价格中受益。特别是当勾结只发生在一方（无论是他们所在的一方还是对立方）时，一些消费者可能会获得利益。这些普遍的结论适用于默许性勾结和卡特尔。

## 3.7. *Mergers*



In this section we first discuss horizontal mergers and work on vertical mergers not related to foreclosure. 

在本节中，我们首先讨论水平合并，并研究与排斥无关的垂直合并。

Chandra and Collard Wexler (2009) were the first to point out that a merger between two-sided platforms needs not lead to high prices. They assume that the readers of two newspapers are heterogenous and advertisers' value depends on the composition of the population reached. Lack of targeting along with uniform cover prices implies that the contribution of a marginal consumer to profit may be negative or positive. 47 If a price increase diverts to the other outlet consumers whose contribution to profit is negative, then a merged entity controlling both outlets may reduce the prices. That a merger may lead to lower prices on one side of the market when externalities are large is confirmed by Leonello (2010) and Cosnita- Langlais et al. (2016) . Indeed, as already highlighted by the analysis of collusion, when the externality generated on the other side is large, it may be more profitable to raise revenue on this other side by boosting participation with lower prices than to extract more profit by raising prices. 48 
The effect of mergers is further investigated by da Silva et al. (2019) using a Cournot model of platforms with single-homing. In this model, each platform sets a quantitative objective, in terms of the number of users it plans to have on each side. Prices on all platforms then adjust and consumers allocate across platforms until all platforms have met their quantitative objective. 49 The Cournot model with homogenous platforms (i.e., platforms that every consumer would find equally attractive for equal network externality) implies that prices adjust to the level of the externality by each platform, so that consumers are indifferent. A merger concentrates agents on fewer platforms, raising participation on both sides of each platform and thus increasing the value of network effects. Higher network effects, combined with the standard effect of a Cournot merger on residual demand elasticity, tends to raise overall margins. When pre-merger margins are large relative to network externalities, all prices increase and consumer surplus declines on both sides. But when all margins are small and total network effects are large, the merger benefits all users due to a reduction of market fragmentation. 50 
The literature related to the impact of mergers in twosided media markets is reviewed in Foros et al. (2015) . In their seminal work on the two-sided approach to media markets, Anderson and Coate (2005) underline the disciplinary role of competition for consumers on the volume of advertising chosen by a media outlet. By relaxing competition, a merger results in more advertising and lower consumer surplus. However, this result is specific to the competitive bottleneck set-up and is reversed if most consumers multi-home (see Anderson et al., 2019 ). In this case, there is little competition for consumers and the traditional effect of a merger prevails on the advertising side: increased market power leads to high advertising prices and lower volume. Prat and Valletti (2019) also point that a merger between media platforms may foster preemptive advertising by incumbent producers, raising barriers to entry on advertised product markets. 

Chandra和Collard Wexler（2009）最早指出，两个双边平台之间的合并并不一定会导致高价格。他们假设两家报纸的读者是异质的，并且广告商的价值取决于所触及人口的组成。缺乏定向投放以及统一的售价意味着边际消费者对利润的贡献可能为负或正。如果价格上涨将那些对利润贡献为负的消费者转移到其他渠道，那么控制两个渠道的合并实体可能会降低价格。Leonello（2010）和Cosnita-Langlais等人（2016）证实了当外部性很大时，合并可能导致市场一侧价格下降。事实上，正如勾结分析已经强调过的那样，在另一方产生了很大外部性时，通过降低价格来提高参与度从而在这一方面获得更多收入可能比通过提高价格来获取更多利润更有利可图。

da Silva等人（2019）使用具有单向归属性平台的Cournot模型进一步研究了合并效应。在该模型中，每个平台都设定一个数量目标，即计划在每个方面拥有的用户数量。然后，所有平台的价格调整，消费者在平台之间进行分配，直到所有平台都达到其数量目标为止。具有同质化平台的Cournot模型意味着价格根据每个平台的外部性水平进行调整，以使消费者感到无差异。合并将主体集中在较少的平台上，在每个平台的两个方面上提高参与度，从而增加网络效应的价值。更高的网络效应与Cournot合并对剩余需求弹性的标准影响相结合，往往会提高总体利润率。当合并前利润率相对于网络外部性较大时，所有价格都会上涨，并且双方消费者剩余下降。但是当所有利润率较小且总体网络效应较大时，由于市场碎片化减少，合并将使所有用户受益。

Foros等人（2015）回顾了与两侧媒体市场中合并影响相关的文献。在Anderson和Coate（2005）关于媒体市场双边方法的开创性工作中，他们强调了竞争对媒体机构选择广告量的约束作用。通过放松竞争，合并导致更多广告和较低的消费者剩余。然而，这个结果特定于竞争瓶颈设置，并且如果大多数消费者使用多个平台，则结果将被颠倒（参见Anderson等人，2019）。在这种情况下，对于消费者来说几乎没有竞争，并且合并对广告方面产生了传统效应：增加的市场力量导致高广告价格和较低的销售量。Prat和Valletti（2019）还指出，媒体平台之间的合并可能会促使现有生产商进行先发制人式广告，从而提高了在广告产品市场上进入的壁垒。

An interesting feature that emerges with mergers of platforms is the possibility of a "see-saw" effect, namely that consumers on one side benefit from the merger while those on the other side are harmed. da Silva et al. (2019) demonstrate that for intermediates levels of externalities, consumers on the highest-cost side (low margin) benefit while consumers on the other side are harmed. Intuitively consumers generating high externality (hence low-margin side) become more attractive when participation on the other side increases and thus should be the first to benefit from the merger when total network effects increase. Anderson and Peitz (2020) identify conditions for a see-saw effect of a free media merger, with decreasing consumer surplus and increasing advertiser surplus; 51 they show that this is less likely to occur with two-sided pricing. 52 
One main difficulty of merger analysis is that, unlike standard merger analysis, competing platforms may have different business models (as discussed in Section 2.3.1 ). Some may charge all sides while others charge only one side; some may rely on subscription while others rely on transaction fees. Moreover, platforms offer different bundles of goods and services. Standard models for merger analysis struggle to cope with such diversity. At the theoretical level, an interesting alternative to standard pricecompetition models explored by De Cornière and Taylor (2020) is to rely on so-called "utility competition"
( Armstrong and Vickers (2001) ), where firm do not compete in price but in total value offered to consumers. They show that this approach can accommodate many features, in particular different business models, and its flexibility could make it suitable for some case handlings. De Cornière and Taylor (2020) exploit this flexibility to discuss the effect of data on the intensity of competition. In the case of vertical integration by a firm using data as input, they show that integration affects the incentives of the upstream subsidiary to invest in data collection. 53 Indeed, the vertically integrated firm may disinvest in data collection and reduce welfare if data is procompetitive downstream. The reverse holds if data weakens competition downstream. The literature on mergers of platform is still in its infancy, due to the difficulty of modeling multi-platform competition. But some lessons already emerge. 54 First, a general presumption that prices increase on all sides following a merger does not hold for platforms. Consequently, it will be necessary to identify more precisely price effects in different contexts. Second, when some agents single-home on both sides, any merger involves some immediate efficiency gains due to larger network externalities in less fragmented markets. Hence, a merger evaluation should focus on prices adjusted for externalities rather than just prices. It can be the case that prices increase but consumer surplus increases due to larger network externalities. Third, as the merger affects different populations on each side, there may be conflicting interests of different groups of users (readers and advertisers, buyers and sellers, etc.). Balancing the interests of the various sides may be a difficult exercise and may require extending the analysis to the value chain outside the platform (for instance, advertisers are themselves intermediaries and, ultimately, we should care about producers and consumers using their services). 

合并平台的一个有趣特点是可能出现“跷跷板”效应，即一方的消费者从合并中受益，而另一方的消费者则受到伤害。da Silva等人（2019）证明，在外部性中间水平下，成本最高一方（低利润率）的消费者受益，而另一方的消费者则受到伤害。直观地说，当参与另一方增加时，产生高外部性（因此低利润率）的消费者变得更具吸引力，并且应该是在总体网络效应增加时首先从合并中获益的人。Anderson和Peitz（2020）确定了自由媒体合并出现跷跷板效应的条件，即减少消费者剩余和增加广告商剩余；他们表明，在两边定价情况下这种情况不太可能发生。

合并分析面临的一个主要困难是与标准合并分析不同之处在于竞争平台可能具有不同的商业模式（如第2.3.1节所讨论）。有些可能向所有方收费，而其他人只向一方收费；有些可能依靠订阅，而其他人依靠交易费用。此外，平台提供不同捆绑的商品和服务。标准合并分析模型难以应对这种多样性。在理论层面上，De Cornière和Taylor（2020）探索了一种有趣的替代标准价格竞争模型的方法，即所谓的“效用竞争”（Armstrong和Vickers，2001），其中公司不是通过价格而是通过向消费者提供的总价值来竞争。他们表明，这种方法可以适应许多特征，特别是不同的商业模式，并且其灵活性使其适用于某些案例处理。De Cornière和Taylor（2020）利用这种灵活性讨论了数据对竞争强度的影响。在使用数据作为输入进行垂直整合时，他们表明整合会影响上游子公司投资于数据收集的激励。确实，在下游存在促进竞争的数据情况下，垂直整合公司可能会减少对数据收集的投资并降低福利。如果数据削弱了下游竞争，则情况相反。关于平台合并的文献仍处于初级阶段，因为建模多平台竞争很困难。但已经出现了一些教训。首先，在平台方面，并非所有方面都会出现价格上涨的普遍假设。因此，需要更准确地确定不同情境下的价格效应。其次，当一些主体在两个方面都只选择一个平台时，任何合并都会带来一些即时效率收益，因为在市场碎片化较少的情况下具有更大的网络外部性。因此，合并评估应该关注调整了外部性后的价格，而不仅仅是价格本身。可能出现价格上涨但消费者剩余由于更大的网络外部性而增加的情况。第三，在合并影响每一方面不同人群时，可能存在不同用户群体（读者和广告商、买家和卖家等）之间利益冲突的情况。平衡各方利益可能是一个困难的过程，并且可能需要将分析扩展到平台之外的价值链（例如，广告商本身就是中介，并且最终我们应该关心使用他们服务的生产者和消费者）。

## 4. **Conclusion**



This article was motivated both by the debate related to the growing role of platforms in the economy and by the need to take stock of 20 years of research in economics on platform competition. The particularity of platforms - and therefore of competition between these platforms - comes in large part from the importance of network externalities. While in a mature industry involving network externalities, one may expect users to be quite homogenous in their expectations, many modern platforms are innovative intermediaries connecting heterogeneous users with heterogenous beliefs (consumers/firms, readers/advertisers,...). This creates scope for price discrimination and complex price and non-price strategies. The question of the efficiency of the competitive process but also of the value of public intervention is therefore structured by the importance of these network externalities. 

本文的动机既源于对经济中平台角色不断增长的辩论，也出于对平台竞争经济学研究20年成果的总结需求。平台的特殊性以及这些平台之间的竞争主要来自于网络外部性的重要性。尽管在涉及网络外部性的成熟行业中，用户期望相对均一，但许多现代平台是创新型中介，连接具有异质信念和异质用户（消费者/企业、读者/广告商等）。这为价格歧视和复杂的价格和非价格策略提供了空间。因此，竞争过程效率以及公共干预价值问题受到这些网络外部性重要性的影响。

What can we say about public intervention in this context? Even though two-sided markets have specific characteristics, traditional anti-trust issues persist. The definition of markets and the measure of competition need to be analyzed/interpreted differently in a two-sided market compared to a standard market, especially when involving a nexus of markets. Once the necessary adaptations have been made–and the economic literature has greatly progressed in this area–it seems quite possible to think about competition policy in the case of platforms with the same philosophy as in standard markets. In particular, when activities involve relatively small network effects, standard anti-trust analysis can be adapted to account for the specificity of platforms and new theories of harm. 

在这种情境下，对于公共干预我们有什么可以说的呢？尽管双边市场具有特定的特征，传统的反垄断问题仍然存在。在双边市场中，与标准市场相比，对市场的定义和竞争的衡量需要进行不同的分析和解释，尤其是当涉及到多个市场之间的关联时。一旦进行了必要的调整——而经济学文献在这方面已经取得了显著进展——我们就可以像在标准市场中一样以相同的理念思考平台竞争政策。特别是当活动涉及相对较小的网络效应时，我们可以根据平台特殊性和新的损害理论来调整标准反垄断分析。

If network effects are large, the question is more intricate. Preserving dynamic competition for the market may require some pro-active intervention. In this regard, we should point out that tipping in digital markets may not resemble a natural monopoly as encountered in infrastructure markets. Large heterogeneity and low entry cost imply that while there may not be room for two large platforms, there are usually niche opportunities for small platforms, which may have the potential to challenge the incumbent. One of the risks associated with a lenient competition policy is that the dominant firm may stifle or buy all the small platforms likely to replace it as the dominant platform. It is important that the sector, even if characterized by significant network effects, allows innovation and the diffusion of innovation. On this front, the ability of consumers to multi-home has been underlined in the literature as important. Even if this behavior slightly decreases the gains of successful entry for a new platform, multi-homing facilitates entry and thus preserves the competitive dynamics without sacrificing too much efficiency. 

如果网络效应很大，问题就更加复杂。为了保持市场的动态竞争，可能需要一些积极的干预。在这方面，需要指出的是，在数字市场中的转折可能并不像基础设施市场中遇到的自然垄断那样。巨大的异质性和低进入成本意味着虽然可能没有容纳两个大型平台的空间，但通常会有小型平台的利基机会，这些小型平台有潜力挑战现有主导者。宽松竞争政策所带来的一个风险是，主导企业可能会扼杀或收购所有有潜力取代其作为主导平台的小型平台。重要的是，即使该领域具有显著网络效应特征，也要允许创新和创新传播。在文献中强调了消费者多重使用对于此至关重要。即使这种行为稍微减少了新平台成功进入所带来的收益，但多重使用促进了进入，并因此保持了竞争动态而不牺牲太多效率。

One potential lesson from these various theory papers is that there can be a number of complex factors affecting the incentives of platforms and market analysis. This raises an interesting legal question around the standard of proof. When it is understood that a large incumbent platform faces complex and potentially anticompetitive incentives–
different than less established platforms–should anticompetitive incentives be demonstrated by the authorities, or should the platform evidence a claim of 'no anticompetitive effect'? 55 
For competition policy, the issues of software interoperability and data sharing need more investigation. 56 For instance, some people have claimed that data can be a source of incumbency advantage (the interested reader can find a discussion of this in Biglaiser et al., 2019 ). The current policy moves and proposals to allow data portability can be seen as the consequence of these ideas, where data is considered as a key input for firms to compete on a market. But the impact on the platform's initial offer of such a measure–which amounts to giving more ownership rights over data to consumers–is far from being clear. 

从这些理论论文中可以得出一个潜在的教训，即影响平台和市场分析激励因素的复杂因素可能有很多。这引发了一个有趣的法律问题，即证明标准。当人们意识到大型现有平台面临复杂且可能具有反竞争激励时，与不太成熟的平台不同，当局应该证明存在反竞争激励，还是平台应该提供“没有反竞争效果”的主张？

对于竞争政策来说，软件互操作性和数据共享的问题需要更多调查。例如，一些人声称数据可以成为现有优势的来源（详见Biglaiser等人2019年的讨论）。目前政策上关于允许数据可移植性的举措和提议可以被视为这些想法的结果，在这些想法中，数据被认为是企业在市场上进行竞争所需的关键输入。然而，此类措施对于平台最初提供内容产生了什么影响——即将更多数据所有权交给消费者——远非清楚可见。

While our article has focused mostly on price competition, non-price dimensions become increasingly the locus of competition, in particular as part of the "economics of free". This implies for instance incorporating product design or information management (recommendations, ratings and feedback systems, marketing.....) in the antitrust practices. Most importantly, behavioral and psychological factors seem to play a key role for many platforms. 57 Research on these factors and their implications for the conduct of competition policy for digital platforms should be of prime importance. 


虽然我们的文章主要关注价格竞争，但非价格维度越来越成为竞争的核心，特别是作为“免费经济学”的一部分。这意味着在反垄断实践中应纳入产品设计或信息管理（如推荐、评级和反馈系统、营销等）等因素。更重要的是，行为和心理因素似乎对许多平台起着关键作用。因此，对于这些因素及其对数字平台竞争政策的影响进行研究至关重要。
