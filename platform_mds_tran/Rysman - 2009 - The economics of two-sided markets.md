## The Economics Of Two-Sided Markets Marc Rysman A



t a local Best Buy, a child places a new Sony PlayStation 3 on the cashier's counter while the parents dig out their Visa card. The gaming system and the payment card may appear to have little connection other than this purchase. However, these two items share an important characteristic that is generating a series of economic insights and has important implications for strategic decision making and economic policymaking. Both video game systems and payment cards are examples of two-sided markets.

在一家当地的百思买商店里，一名孩子将一台全新的索尼PlayStation 3放在收银台上，而父母则取出他们的Visa信用卡。尽管这次购买似乎只是游戏系统和支付卡之间的简单关联，然而，这两个物品共享一个重要特征，它们正在引发一系列经济洞察，并对战略决策和经济政策制定产生重要影响。视频游戏系统和支付卡都是双边市场的典型例子。

Broadly speaking, a two-sided market is one in which 1) two sets of agents interact through an intermediary or platform, and 2) the decisions of each set of agents affects the outcomes of the other set of agents, typically through an externality. In the case of a video game system, the intermediary is the console producer—Sony in the scenario above—while the two sets of agents are consumers and video game developers. Neither consumers nor game developers will be interested in the PlayStation if the other party is not. Similarly, a successful payment card requires both consumer usage and merchant acceptance, where both consumers and merchants value each others' participation. Many more products fit into this paradigm, such as search engines, newspapers, and almost any advertisersupported media (examples in which consumers often negatively value, rather than positively value, the participation of the other side), as well as most software or title-based operating systems and consumer electronics. Malls which seek retailers and consumers, convention organizers which seek buyers and sellers, dating services which seek men and women, and *The Journal of Economic Perspectives* which seeks content and readership, all experience the economics of two-sided markets. The multi-sided nature of many Internet and high-technology markets, as well as new payment systems and media outlets, suggest that two-sided and multi-sided markets are becoming increasingly important.

一般而言，双边市场是指1）通过中介或平台进行互动的两组主体，2）每组主体的决策会通过外部性影响另一组主体的结果。以视频游戏系统为例，中介即为控制台生产商（如上文所述的索尼），而两组主体则分别是消费者和视频游戏开发者。如果没有对方的参与，消费者和游戏开发者都不会对PlayStation产生兴趣。同样地，一个成功的支付卡需要消费者使用和商家接受，而消费者和商家都重视对方的参与。许多其他产品也符合这个范式，比如搜索引擎、报纸以及几乎所有由广告支持的媒体（这些例子中消费者通常对另一方的参与产生负面价值而不是正面价值），以及大多数软件或基于标题的操作系统和消费电子产品。购物中心寻求零售商和消费者、会展组织寻求买家和卖家、配对服务寻求男性和女性用户、《经济展望杂志》寻求内容和读者群体等都经历了双边市场经济学。互联网和高科技市场以及新型支付系统和媒体渠道的多边性质表明，双边和多边市场正变得越来越重要。

This paper seeks to explain what two-sided markets are and why they interest economists. I discuss the strategies that firms typically consider, and I highlight a number of puzzling outcomes from the perspective of the economics of two-sided markets. Finally, I consider the implications for public policy, particularly antitrust and regulatory policy, where there have been a number of recent issues involving media, computer operating systems, and payment cards.

本文旨在阐述双边市场的概念以及为何引起经济学家的兴趣。我探讨了企业通常考虑的策略，并强调了从双边市场经济学角度看一些令人困惑的结果。最后，我考虑了对公共政策的影响，特别是在媒体、计算机操作系统和支付卡等领域近期出现的一系列问题上，涉及反垄断和监管政策。

## What Defines A Two-Sided Market?



The literature on two-sided markets is distinguished by its focus on the actions of the market intermediary. Generally speaking, research in two-sided markets explores choices by market intermediaries, particularly pricing, when there is some kind of interdependence or externality between groups of agents that the intermediary serves. The externality could involve usage or membership. For instance, payment card users care about how many merchants are members of the same card network, not about how much any merchant transacts over the network. In contrast, in picking which networks to accept, merchants care more about which networks consumers actually use rather than which networks consumers hold cards on.

双边市场的文献以对市场中介行为的关注而著称。一般而言，双边市场的研究探索了市场中介在为一组主体提供服务时，特别是在存在某种相互依赖或外部性的情况下，进行的选择，尤其是定价方面。这种外部性可能涉及使用或成员资格。例如，支付卡用户关心同一卡网络的商家数量，而不是任何商家在该网络上进行交易的金额。相反，在选择接受哪些网络时，商家更关心消费者实际使用哪些网络，而不是消费者持有哪些卡片上的网络。

Of course, one-sided markets have intermediaries, too. For example, consider a farmer that sells a product to a grocery store once and does not otherwise interact with the grocer. The grocer then picks a retail price based on inventory and demand. In this one-sided market, the farmer collects the wholesale price and is then indifferent to the success of the grocer in actually selling the good. The distinguishing feature in this case is whether the seller is paid based on the success of the platform with the buying side.1 Strikingly, one-sided and two-sided selling strategies exist side-by-side at Amazon.com. For some products, like certain new books, Amazon (basically) buys at a wholesale price and sells for a retail price, which is a one-sided model. But for many other products, Amazon provides a web portal for a producer that sets the retail price that a consumer would see. As this distinction often depends on the decisions of the intermediary rather than on purely technological features of the market, it may be better to use the term "two-sided strategies" rather than "two-sided markets." Regardless, how Amazon formal model of grocery stores as a two-sided market. In his model, the grocery store sets the price per consumer, and the wholesaler is paid based on how many consumers show up. That contrasts with my characterization of a grocery store, in which a wholesaler sells a product for a known sum, the retailer takes possession of the product and sells the product as it wishes, and the wholesaler has no concern for how many units the retailer is able to sell. In my view, a grocery store is in a one-sided market, but Armstrong would disagree.

当然，单边市场也存在中介。例如，考虑一个农民将产品一次性销售给杂货店，并且不再与杂货店进行其他互动。随后，杂货店根据库存和需求确定零售价格。在这种单边市场中，农民收取批发价格，并对杂货店实际销售商品的成功无所谓。这种情况的区别在于卖方是否根据平台与购买方的成功而获得报酬。令人惊讶的是，在亚马逊上同时存在单边和双边销售策略。对于某些产品，比如某些新书，亚马逊（基本上）以批发价购买并以零售价出售，这是一种单边模式。但对于许多其他产品，亚马逊为生产商提供了一个网络门户，在该门户上生产商设定消费者所见的零售价格。由于这种区别通常取决于中介机构的决策而不仅仅是市场纯技术特征，因此使用术语“双边策略”而不是“双边市场”可能更为恰当。无论如何，亚马逊将杂货店形式化为一个双边市场模型。在该模型中，杂货店为每个消费者设定价格，并根据出现的消费者数量支付给批发商。这与我对杂货店的描述形成了对比，在我的观点中，杂货店处于一个单边市场，但阿姆斯特朗可能会持不同意见。

makes this choice about whether to be one-sided or two-sided is an important question for this literature.

对于这个文献来说，决定是选择单边还是双边的问题非常重要。

This definition of a two-sided market may seem very broad, or overly inclusive.

这个对双边市场的定义可能看起来非常广泛，或者过于包容。

That is not a problem in my view. The interesting question is often not whether a market can be defined as two-sided—virtually all markets might be two-sided to some extent—but how important two-sided issues are in determining outcomes of interest. For instance, if an auto manufacturer sells many products in a single neighborhood, local mechanics may develop expertise in that type of car, which encourages further sales by the manufacturer in the future. Hence, the market for autos could be viewed as two-sided because manufacturers must attract both consumers and mechanic expertise. At present, even if such a network effect exists, it seems of little importance either in the minds of market participants or in determining market outcomes. That is, although two-sidedness may exist in practically all markets, it is not always quantitatively important. But at times in the past, these sorts of two-sided issues may have been very important in the auto industry— perhaps when autos were first diffusing across the United States. Such networks could also become important in the next decade as the auto industry considers alternative engine configurations and new sources of fuel.

在我看来，并不是一个问题。有趣的问题通常不是市场是否可以被定义为双边的，几乎所有市场在某种程度上都可能是双边的，而是双边问题在决定感兴趣的结果方面有多重要。例如，如果一家汽车制造商在一个社区内销售许多产品，当地的机械师可能会对该类型的汽车开发出专业知识，从而鼓励制造商未来进一步销售。因此，汽车市场可以被视为双边市场，因为制造商必须吸引消费者和机械师的专业知识。目前，在市场参与者心中或决定市场结果方面，即使存在这样的网络效应，似乎并不重要。也就是说，尽管几乎所有市场都可能存在双边性，但它并不总是数量上重要。但在过去的某些时期，在汽车行业中这类双边问题可能非常重要——也许是当汽车首次扩散到美国各地时。随着汽车行业考虑替代发动机配置和新能源来源，在未来十年中这样的网络也可能变得重要起来。

The emphasis on market intermediaries is the main distinction between the literature on two-sided markets and the literature on network effects, and on indirect network effects in particular. The definitions are similar: a good exhibits an indirect network effect if demand for the good depends on the provision of a complementary good, which in turn depends on demand for the original good (for example, Church and Gandal, 1992; Chou and Shy, 1990). Indeed, in a technical sense, the literature on two-sided markets could be seen as a subset of the literature on network effects.2 However, papers on two-sided markets tend to focus on the actions of the market intermediary, particularly pricing choices, whereas papers on network effects typically focus on adoption by users and optimal network size. Also, the literatures differ somewhat in industry focus, with papers on two-sided markets focusing more on media, payments systems, and matching markets, and the networks papers focusing more on high-technology and telecommunication markets. However, the difference in industries is not crucial, and there are exceptions on both sides. Parker and Van Alstyne (2000) is an early two-sided markets paper that studies operating systems. Similarly, matching markets can be seen as two-sided in the sense that the matching "platform" (for instance, a dating service) is more attractive as more participants sign up. Caillaud and Julien (2003) and Damiano and Li (2008) study matching markets from this perspective.

两边市场文献与网络效应文献之间的主要区别在于对市场中介的重视，尤其是定价选择。尽管两者的定义相似，即商品的需求取决于提供补充商品，而补充商品又取决于对原始商品的需求（例如，Church和Gandal，1992年；Chou和Shy，1990年），但从技术角度来看，两边市场文献可以被视为网络效应文献的一个子集。然而，在论文内容上存在一些差异：两边市场的论文更关注市场中介的行动，特别是定价选择；而网络效应的论文通常更关注用户采用和最优网络规模。此外，在行业关注方面也有所不同：两边市场的论文更多关注媒体、支付系统和匹配市场，而网络效应方面的论文则更多关注高科技和电信市场。然而，行业上的差异并不是关键因素，并且在双方都存在例外情况。Parker和Van Alstyne（2000年）是一篇早期研究操作系统的两边市场论文。同样地，匹配市场也可以被视为具有双边性质，即随着更多参与者注册，匹配平台（例如约会服务）变得更具吸引力。Caillaud和Julien（2003年）以及Damiano和Li（2008年）从这个角度研究了匹配市场。

[重写后的中文内容，保持准确性和学术风格]

In the discussion that follows, I focus on three products that exemplify the different types of technologies and business models in which two-sided markets are important. The first product is newspapers, and media more broadly. Newspapers are a canonical two-sided market, where the newspaper provides a platform for communication from advertisers to consumers. Consumer prices depend on advertiser demand to reach those consumers. Advertising prices depend on consumer demand for advertising as well, with relatively low prices for advertisements that consumers more highly value (such as classified advertisements and some local advertisements). The straightforward set-up of newspapers makes them relatively easy to analyze.3
The second industry I discuss in depth is the payment card industry. Payment cards like Visa, MasterCard, and American Express are two-sided in the sense that they require consumer usage and merchant acceptance to be successful. Visa and Mastercard have been particularly controversial. They have historically been organized as associations of banks that provide a clearinghouse for transactions using their cards. When a consumer purchases a product with a payment card, the consumer pays the consumer's bank, which transfers money to the merchant's bank, which then pays the merchant. The merchant pays a fee to the merchant's bank, which is typically less than 3 percent. Of great controversy is that the merchant's bank must pay the consumer's bank an "interchange fee," a percent of each transaction. The merchant's fee is set to reflect this cost and is usually only slightly higher than the interchange fee. The interchange fee is set by the card association, and in this sense is set cooperatively by the member banks. (Visa and Mastercard also extract a fee for each transaction, which is used to fund their operations, but this fee is relatively small and has been uncontroversial in credit cards to date.) The interchange fee presumably explains why banks can offer generous rewards programs to consumers for using their credit cards.

在接下来的讨论中，我将重点关注三种代表不同类型技术和商业模式的产品，这些产品中双边市场非常重要。首先是报纸和媒体行业。报纸是一个典型的双边市场，广告商通过报纸向消费者传达信息。消费者价格取决于广告商对消费者的需求。广告价格也取决于消费者对广告的需求，对于消费者更有价值的广告（如分类广告和一些本地广告），价格相对较低。报纸的设置相对简单，因此比较容易进行分析。

我详细讨论的第二个行业是支付卡行业。像Visa、MasterCard和American Express这样的支付卡在某种程度上也是双边市场，它们需要消费者使用和商家接受才能成功。Visa和Mastercard尤其具有争议性。它们历来被组织为银行协会，为使用他们的卡进行交易提供清算服务。当消费者用支付卡购买商品时，消费者向自己所属银行支付款项，该银行将资金转给商家所属银行，然后由后者向商家支付款项。商家向自己所属银行支付一定费用，通常低于3%。引起争议的是，商家所属银行必须向消费者所属银行支付“互换费”，即每笔交易的一定比例。商家的费用被设定为反映这个成本，并且通常只略高于互换费。互换费由卡协会设定，在这个意义上是由成员银行合作设定的。（Visa和Mastercard还从每笔交易中收取一笔手续费，用于资助它们的运营，但这笔手续费相对较小，在信用卡领域尚未引起争议。）互换费可能解释了为什么银行可以向消费者提供慷慨的信用卡奖励计划。

The joint setting of the interchange fee raises the specter of collusion, and certainly the interchange fee appears to be high relative to any costs that are incurred on the merchant side or the consumer side. However, as Rochet and Tirole (2002) point out, if serving consumers and merchants is perfectly competitive, then the interchange fee does not affect the profits of the member banks. Rather, banks will compete the subsidy or cost away so that the card association and member banks do not earn a profit. In this scenario, the interchange fee primarily affects the terms that merchants and consumers face and the total volume of transactions. We can raise questions about whether this view of the market is overly simplified, and much of the progress in research on two-sided markets has been motivated by public policy toward card associations and the interchange fee. I take up some of these policy concerns in the final section of the paper. Note that Mastercard and Visa incorporated in 2006 and 2007 and so are organized as for-profit corporations rather than as associations or cooperatives. These changes do not appear to have led to a strategic change with respect to interchange policy.

互换费的联合设定引发了勾结的担忧，而且相对于商家和消费者所承担的任何成本来说，互换费似乎过高。然而，正如Rochet和Tirole（2002）所指出的，如果为消费者和商家提供服务是完全竞争的话，那么互换费不会影响成员银行的利润。相反地，银行将通过补贴或成本竞争来消除利润，以使卡协会和成员银行不获得利润。在这种情况下，互换费主要影响商家和消费者面临的条件以及交易总量。我们可以对市场是否过于简化提出疑问，并且许多关于卡协会和互换费的研究进展都是基于公共政策的动机。我在论文的最后一节中探讨了其中一些政策问题。需要注意的是，Mastercard和Visa在2006年和2007年注册为营利性公司，而不再是协会或合作社组织。这些变化似乎并没有导致与互换政策相关的战略变化。

The third product I discuss is operating systems. Operating systems provide an interface between hardware devices such as computer devices, cellular telephones, or video game consoles on the one hand and software applications such as word processors, ring tones, and video games on the other. A successful operating system requires consumer adoption as well as software development by software vendors. Some operating systems, like certain video game consoles, are inseparable from their hardware, whereas some, such as Microsoft Windows, require independent hardware production. Many papers that study operating systems identify themselves with network effects rather than two-sided markets so perhaps this example is less canonical, but as I have argued, the two literatures have a lot in common. As we shall see, these markets are particularly useful for exploring issues of openness.

我要讨论的第三个产品是操作系统。操作系统在硬件设备（如计算机设备、手机或视频游戏机）与软件应用（如文字处理器、铃声和视频游戏）之间提供接口。一个成功的操作系统需要消费者采用，并由软件供应商进行软件开发。有些操作系统，比如某些视频游戏机，与其硬件是不可分割的，而有些则需要独立的硬件生产，比如微软Windows。许多研究操作系统的论文将自己归类为网络效应而不是双边市场，所以也许这个例子不太典型，但正如我所主张的那样，这两个领域有很多共同之处。正如我们将看到的那样，这些市场对于探索开放性问题特别有用。

## Strategies



The two most important strategies that a potential platform firm chooses are price and openness. The pricing decision has been the subject of rigorous research; openness has so far proven more difficult to analyze. This section discusses pricing and openness, as well as several other strategic decisions that have received little attention to date. Pricing Pricing looks unusual in two-sided markets. Consumers pay to receive most newspapers, but not a Yellow Pages directory or an Internet search engine. Consumers do not pay per advertisement in their newspaper but must pay to use more video games with their game console. Many consumers are in effect paid to use a credit card—with rewards programs such as contributions to frequent flyer plans. Theoretically, it is often hard to establish whether a given price in a two-sided market is higher or lower than socially optimal, or even whether greater competition would make the existing price rise or fall. What is going on?

潜在的平台公司选择的两个最重要的策略是定价和开放性。定价决策已经成为严格研究的对象，而对于开放性的分析则更加困难。本节将讨论定价和开放性，以及一些迄今未受到足够关注的其他战略决策。在双边市场中，定价显得与众不同。消费者需要支付费用才能获取大多数报纸，但却不需要为黄页目录或互联网搜索引擎付费。消费者不需要按照广告数量付费来阅读报纸，但却必须为使用更多视频游戏与游戏机配套付费。许多消费者实际上通过信用卡获得报酬，例如通过贡献常旅客计划来获得奖励积分。从理论上讲，在双边市场中往往很难确定某个给定价格是高于还是低于社会最优价格，甚至是否更大的竞争会使现有价格上升还是下降。到底发生了什么？

Pricing in two-sided markets has received considerable attention in formal economic research. The main result is that pricing to one side of the market depends not only on the demand and costs that those consumers bring but also on how their participation affects participation on the other side and the profit that is extracted from that participation. In a one-sided market, we can characterize the price–cost mark-up in terms of elasticity of demand and the marginal cost. But in a two-sided market, pricing decisions will also include the elasticity of the response on the other side and the mark-up charged to the other side.

双边市场的定价问题在正式的经济学研究中受到了广泛关注。主要研究结果表明，对市场一方的定价不仅取决于这些消费者带来的需求和成本，还取决于他们的参与对另一方参与度和从中获得的利润的影响。在单边市场中，我们可以通过需求弹性和边际成本来确定价格-成本溢价。然而，在双边市场中，定价决策还需要考虑到对其他一方反应弹性以及向其收取的溢价。

Since the platform faces a similar computation on the other side, prices on both sides of the market depend on the joint set of demand elasticities and marginal costs on each side (Rochet and Tirole, 2003, 2006; Weyl, 2009). This result has important implications for prices. For instance, in any market, prices typically fall as the price elasticity of demand increases, but in a two-sided market the effect can be even larger: The low price on one side not only attracts elastic consumers on that side but also, as a result, leads to higher prices or more participation on the other side. The increased value extracted from the other side magnifies the value of having consumers on the first side, which leads to a yet bigger price decrease and quantity increase for the side that experiences the increase in elasticity.

鉴于平台在另一方面也面临类似的计算，市场两侧的价格取决于各方的需求弹性和边际成本的综合集合（Rochet和Tirole，2003年，2006年；Weyl，2009年）。这一结果对价格产生重要影响。例如，在任何市场中，随着需求弹性增加，价格通常会下降，但在双边市场中，这种影响可能更为显著：一方的低价不仅吸引了该方弹性消费者的参与，还导致了另一方面价格上涨或参与度增加。从另一方面获得的增值放大了拥有第一方消费者的价值，从而导致体验到需求弹性增加的那一方出现更大幅度的价格下降和数量增加。

Such seeming anomalies as price below marginal cost or even negative prices can easily arise in a two-sided market. For example, a platform might charge a price below cost on one side if those agents have a large price elasticity and their participation attracts a large number of participants on the other side who are relatively price inelastic (and hence have a high mark-up). Consider Microsoft, which makes it very easy to become a software developer for the Windows operating system and arguably subsidizes this activity with tutorials and supportive websites. Presumably, Microsoft has set the price to developers well below what the cost of serving them and their demand would imply in a simple one-sided model. However, consumers value developer participation, and consumers pay a mark-up over marginal cost that makes attracting the developers worthwhile for Microsoft, even at the expense of potential profits Microsoft could be making from the developer side.

在双边市场中，出现价格低于边际成本甚至负价格等看似异常的情况并不罕见。举例来说，如果一个平台上的一方主体具有较大的价格弹性，并且他们的参与能够吸引另一方相对价格不弹性（从而具有高利润率）的大量参与者，那么该平台可能会对前者收取低于成本价的价格。以微软为例，它极大地简化了成为Windows操作系统软件开发人员的过程，并通过教程和支持网站提供支持。可以推测，微软将开发人员定价设置得远低于简单单边模型中所需服务成本和满足需求所带来的成本。然而，消费者非常重视开发者参与度，并且愿意支付超过边际成本的溢价来吸引开发者，即使这样做可能会牺牲微软从开发者那一方获得潜在利润。

If there are multiple competing market intermediaries, the effect of participation of one side on the other has even more bite. Consider two competing platforms pricing to consumers and sellers. As without competition, the consumer price depends on consumer demand, consumer cost, and the mark-up to sellers. But now, lowering the consumer price attracts consumers from the competing platform, which degrades the value of the competitor to buyers, and hence leads to a larger increase in buyer interest in the original platform. Hence, the "twosidedness" of pricing can be more pronounced in competitive markets.

如果存在多个竞争的市场中介，一方的参与对另一方的影响将更加显著。考虑两个竞争平台向消费者和卖家定价的情况。在没有竞争的情况下，消费者价格取决于消费者需求、消费者成本以及对卖家的溢价。然而，现在降低消费者价格会吸引来自竞争平台的消费者，从而降低了竞争对买家的价值，进而导致原始平台上买家兴趣更大地增加。因此，在竞争激烈的市场中，“双边定价”的效果可能更加显著。

The extent of this effect is in part determined by the way in which agents move from one platform to another—do they shift only some usage from one platform to another or do they move all of their usage? In the real world, we observe both outcomes, often in the same market. Merchants typically accept payment on multiple networks—for example, Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover—as well as via alternatives such as on-line debit cards and personal checks. Meanwhile, consumers typically stick to a single card for months at a time (Rysman, 2007a). At the level of a transaction, consumers almost never split payments across multiple options.

这种效应的程度在一定程度上取决于主体从一个平台转移到另一个平台的方式——他们是只在某个平台上部分使用，还是全部转移使用？在现实世界中，我们观察到这两种结果经常出现在同一市场中。商家通常接受多个网络的支付方式，例如Visa、Mastercard、American Express和Discover，以及在线借记卡和个人支票等替代方式。与此同时，消费者通常会连续几个月只使用一张信用卡（Rysman, 2007a）。在每笔交易中，消费者几乎从不将付款分散到多个选项上。

In fact, two-sided markets often seem to evolve toward to a situation where members of one side use a single platform and the other side uses multiple platforms; Armstrong (2006, Section 5) makes this point and provides formal analysis. Payment cards are one example. In markets with multiple newspapers, consumers typically read only one newspaper whereas advertisers appear in all of them. This generalization is less true in video games, although even there consumers usually (but not always) buy only one console, and video games distributed for multiple consoles are becoming more common (Lee, 2008; Corts and Lederman, forthcoming).

实际上，双边市场往往会演变成一种情况，即一方的成员使用单个平台，而另一方的成员使用多个平台（Armstrong，2006年第5节）。支付卡就是一个例子。在拥有多家报纸的市场中，消费者通常只阅读其中一家报纸，而广告商则出现在所有报纸上。尽管在视频游戏领域这种概括不太适用，但消费者通常（但并非总是）只购买一个游戏机，并且为多个游戏机分发的视频游戏越来越普遍（Lee, 2008; Corts and Lederman, forthcoming）。

Why does this issue matter? It is because the intermediary can be viewed as a monopolist over access to members that do not use other intermediaries. Hence, firms compete aggressively on the side that uses a single network in order to charge monopoly prices to the other side that is trying to reach them (Armstrong, 2006). As a result, competition between platforms can have large price effects on the side of the market that uses a single platform and little or no effect on the side that uses multiple platforms. This result might explain why payment card pricing has increasingly favored consumers over time rather than merchants (for instance, with the rise of rewards programs), since consumers and not merchants typically use a single network and competition among card networks has become more important relative to competition between card networks and cash.

为什么这个问题很重要？因为中介机构可以被视为对不使用其他中介机构的成员的访问具有垄断地位。因此，企业在使用单一网络的一方上进行激烈竞争，以向试图接触他们的另一方收取垄断价格（Armstrong, 2006）。结果是，平台之间的竞争可能对使用单一平台的市场方产生较大的价格影响，而对使用多个平台的市场方几乎没有影响。这个结果或许可以解释为什么支付卡定价随着时间推移越来越有利于消费者而不是商家（例如，随着奖励计划的兴起），因为消费者通常而不是商家使用单一网络，并且卡网络之间的竞争相对于卡网络与现金之间的竞争变得更加重要。

Another important issue in a two-sided framework is price discrimination. In a situation of demand heterogeneity, standard price discrimination—for instance, by manipulating the prices for participation and usage—allows a platform to capture more of the surplus on the side with discrimination. Thus, discrimination increases the value extracted on one side, which leads to lower prices on the other side which has now become more valuable (Weyl, 2009). In addition, two-sided markets allow for a new form of price discrimination: discrimination based on heterogeneity in the attractiveness of an agent to the other side. For instance, supermarkets resisted accepting payment cards for a time, but they are highly desirable clients for payment card companies both because of their transaction volume and because regular consumer usage at supermarkets helps encourage consumer usage in other situations. Hence, payment associations offered supermarkets relatively low interchange fees, which led to low bank fees and ultimately to the adoption of payment card usage by supermarkets. Similarly, Sony and Microsoft have given Electronic Arts, the largest game manufacturer, advantageous contracts in order to attract games to their consoles (Eisenman, Parker, and Van Alstyne, 2006). Caillaud and Jullien (2003) show how an entering platform can use price discrimination to be successful even when market participants expect the entrant to fail.

在双边框架中，另一个重要问题是价格歧视。在需求异质性的情况下，通过操纵参与和使用的价格进行标准的价格歧视，使平台能够在具有歧视性的一方捕获更多剩余价值。因此，歧视增加了一方提取价值的能力，从而导致另一方（现在变得更有价值）降低价格（Weyl, 2009）。此外，双边市场还允许一种新形式的价格歧视：基于对其他一方吸引力的异质性进行歧视。例如，超市曾经抵制接受支付卡支付，但它们对支付卡公司来说是非常理想的客户，因为超市交易量大，并且消费者在超市常规使用支付卡有助于鼓励他们在其他场合使用。因此，支付协会向超市提供相对较低的互换费用，从而导致银行费用降低，并最终促使超市采用支付卡。类似地，索尼和微软为了吸引游戏到他们的游戏机上给予了最大游戏制造商Electronic Arts优惠合同（Eisenman, Parker, and Van Alstyne, 2006）。Caillaud和Jullien（2003）展示了一个进入平台如何利用价格歧视在市场参与者预计该进入者失败的情况下取得成功。

Two-sided markets raise questions for dynamic pricing as well. Penetration pricing, such as when an intermediary lowers price early in the product life cycle and raises it after having established a base, is a natural outcome in two-sided markets. For instance, the independent Yellow Pages publisher "Yellow Book" has a policy of offering advertisement for free in the first year it enters a new city. This strategy makes sense because Yellow Book recognizes that doing so will generate usage, which Yellow Book can capitalize on in the future. Similarly, it is common to establish a technological standard through free distribution of a basic product (for instance, Adobe's free distribution of Reader popularizes the PDF standard) and then profit on peripheral products (such as Adobe Acrobat).

双边市场对于动态定价也提出了一些问题。在双边市场中，渗透定价是一种自然的结果。例如，当一个中介在产品生命周期的早期降低价格，并在建立了一定基础后提高价格。举例来说，独立的黄页出版商“Yellow Book”有一个政策，在进入一个新城市的第一年免费提供广告。这种策略是有道理的，因为Yellow Book意识到这样做将会产生使用量，而这将为Yellow Book未来的发展带来利益。类似地，通过免费分发基本产品（例如Adobe免费分发Reader推广PDF标准），然后通过周边产品（如Adobe Acrobat）获利来建立技术标准也是常见的做法。

Openness In the literature on two-sided markets, openness refers to two specific strategic issues. The first is the number of sides to pursue: a potential platform firm must choose whether to be one-sided, two-sided, or multi-sided. The second is how to relate to competing platforms: platforms may seek incompatibility, compatibility, or some sort of integration.

在双边市场的文献中，开放性指的是两个具体的战略问题。首先是追求多少个方面：潜在的平台公司必须选择是单一方面、双方面还是多方面。其次是如何与竞争平台建立关系：平台可以寻求不兼容性、兼容性或某种形式的整合。

As an example of the decision over how many sides to pursue, consider operating systems. Apple produces both its computer hardware and its computer operating system, whereas Microsoft controls only the operating system and counts on independent manufacturers to supply hardware. In this sense, Microsoft is more open than Apple. This choice is somewhat akin to a choice over vertical integration, although the relationship between hardware and operating systems is not strictly vertical. Rather, to the extent that a platform does not integrate, it often introduces another side to the multi-sided market calculation. That is, we can characterize Microsoft as managing a three-sided market between consumers, software providers, and hardware providers, whereas Apple manages only a two-sided market between consumers and software providers.

以操作系统为例，考虑追求多个方面的决策。苹果既生产计算机硬件又生产计算机操作系统，而微软仅控制操作系统，并依赖独立制造商提供硬件。从这个意义上说，微软比苹果更具开放性。这种选择类似于垂直整合的选择，尽管硬件和操作系统之间的关系并非严格垂直。相反，只要一个平台不进行整合，它往往会引入多边市场计算中的另一个方面。换言之，我们可以将微软描述为在消费者、软件提供商和硬件提供商之间管理一个三边市场，而苹果仅管理消费者和软件提供商之间的双边市场。

A platform may decide to change its strategy toward integration as its market evolves. For instance, Microsoft has controversially included software applications in its operating system that were also supplied by third party suppliers, such as browser software, media players, and video editing. To the extent that doing so eliminated an independent software market, Microsoft apparently viewed it as worthwhile to reduce the number of sides in its business model.4
Incorporated in this decision over openness is the decision of whether to be two-sided or one-sided. Being one-sided is in effect an extreme move away from openness where a firm integrates to the extent that there is no longer a two-sided market interaction. Perhaps it is more natural to observe firms begin with a one-sided model and switch to a two-sided model as they become more established. Doing so allows potential platforms to overcome the "chicken-and-egg" problem by first providing complementary goods themselves (sometimes requiring daunting capital expenditures). For example, Amazon first established itself as a fairly standard on-line book retailer before introducing its "marketplace" options where sellers set prices and interact with consumers.

随着市场的发展，一个平台可能会决定改变其整合策略。例如，微软在其操作系统中引入了由第三方供应商提供的软件应用程序，如浏览器软件、媒体播放器和视频编辑软件，这一举动引起了争议。微软显然认为减少其商业模式中的双边市场交互方面是值得的，尽管这样做会消除一个独立的软件市场。

在决定是否开放以及选择双边还是单边时，也涉及到整合策略的考虑。选择单边实际上是远离开放性的极端措施，其中一个公司进行整合到没有再存在双边市场交互。也许更自然地观察到公司从单边模式开始，并在逐渐确立自身地位后转向双边模式。这样做可以让潜在平台克服“先有鸡还是先有蛋”的问题，首先自己提供互补商品（有时需要大量资本支出）。例如，在推出卖家设定价格并与消费者互动的“市场”选项之前，亚马逊首先作为一个相当标准的在线书店建立起来。

Thus, it may be better to discuss two-sided "strategies" rather than two-sided
"markets," because two-sidedness is an endogenous choice in some markets, not a technologically determined outcome. The Palm group of products provides an example. When the Palm personal digital assistant was first introduced, Palm
4 From different perspectives, the same business may have different numbers of sides. For instance, it is common to think of Microsoft as managing a three-sided market between consumers, software developers, and hardware manufacturers. However, in evaluating some strategies—such as Microsoft's approach to the browser market—it may be more useful to recognize Microsoft as a many-sided market between, for instance, spreadsheet software providers, word processing software providers, browser providers, business consumers, home consumers, laptop and desktop manufacturers, printer manufacturers, and others.

因此，在某些市场中，更好地讨论双边“策略”而不是双边“市场”可能更为恰当，因为双边性是一种内生选择，而非技术决定的结果。Palm产品系列提供了一个例子。当Palm个人数字助理首次推出时，Palm公司将其定位为一个相对标准的在线书店。

从不同的角度来看，同一家企业可能具有不同数量的方面。例如，我们通常认为微软在消费者、软件开发商和硬件制造商之间管理着一个三方市场。然而，在评估一些策略（如微软对浏览器市场的方法）时，将微软视为一个多方面市场可能更有用，其中包括电子表格软件提供商、文字处理软件提供商、浏览器提供商、企业消费者、家庭消费者、笔记本和台式机制造商、打印机制造商等等。

produced its own hardware, operating system, and applications software. Hence, it followed a one-sided model. Palm eventually pursued independent software application development, but only after it had sold millions of units (Eisenmann and Hagiu, 2007). Still, the Palm devices all ran the Palm operating system, and Palm licensed very few non-Palm devices to do so. That business pattern changed recently when Palm divested itself into an operating system company and a hardware company. The hardware firm has recently introduced the first Palm device that runs a Windows operating system, and the operating system is currently attempting to attract widespread device production.

因此，它采用了单边模式。然而，只有在销售了数百万台设备之后，Palm才追求独立的软件应用开发（Eisenmann和Hagiu，2007）。尽管如此，所有的Palm设备仍然运行着Palm操作系统，并且Palm几乎没有授权非Palm设备使用该操作系统。最近，Palm进行了业务模式的改变，将自身分为一个操作系统公司和一个硬件公司。硬件公司最近推出了第一款运行Windows操作系统的Palm设备，并且该操作系统目前正试图吸引更多的设备生产。

Up to now, we have discussed openness in terms of operating systems but we have not mentioned payment cards or newspapers. These markets seem much less flexible in terms of the choice of two-sidedness. Some payment cards and media are clearly one-sided. For instance, store cards and gas cards are payment cards that allow the consumer to use payment card features at a single company. Since all uses of the card are at a single company, they represent a one-sided approach to payments. Similarly, some media does not take advertising and is largely supported by subscriptions, such as *Consumer Reports* and *Cook's Illustrated.* However, outside of some particular cases, the basic model of payment cards and media is a two-sided one. In other words, the technology of these industries is such that adding or eliminating sides to their markets is not an important option.

迄今为止，我们已经讨论了操作系统的开放性，但尚未提及支付卡或报纸。从双边选择的角度来看，这些市场似乎要灵活得多。一些支付卡和媒体明显是单边的。例如，商店卡和加油卡是允许消费者在单一公司使用支付卡功能的支付卡。由于该卡的所有用途都在一个公司内进行，它们代表了一种单边化的支付方式。同样地，一些媒体不接受广告，并且主要依靠订阅来支持，例如《Consumer Reports》和《Cook's Illustrated》。然而，在某些特殊情况之外，支付卡和媒体的基本模式是双边模式。换句话说，这些行业的技术使得增加或减少市场方面并不是一个重要选项。

Whereas the first meaning of openness refers to whether to be multi-sided, the second meaning of openness refers to the decision over compatibility and inclusiveness toward rival platforms. If the first meaning of openness is similar to the choice over vertical integration, this second meaning is akin to choosing horizontal relationships. Compatibility refers to the ability of a consumer using one platform to reach a seller using another. Compatibility need not be a "zero-one" decision. A bank that signs up with a network of automatic teller machines (ATMs) can interact with depositors that use any ATM associated with the network, but surcharges make ATMs owned by other banks more or less "compatible" with a given bank's ATM system (Knittel and Stango, 2008; Hannan, Kiser, Prager, and McAndrews, 2003).

然而，开放性的第一个含义指的是是否具有多边性，而开放性的第二个含义则是指对竞争平台的兼容性和包容性的决策。如果将开放性的第一个含义类比为垂直整合的选择，那么第二个含义则类似于选择水平关系。兼容性是指消费者使用一个平台能否与使用另一个平台的卖家进行交流。兼容性并非一种“零一”决策。例如，与自动取款机(ATM)网络签约的银行可以与使用该网络关联的任何ATM机上存款人进行互动，但附加费使得其他银行拥有的ATM机与特定银行的ATM系统在兼容性上存在差异(Knittel和Stango, 2008; Hannan、Kiser、Prager和McAndrews, 2003)。

This aspect of openness is important for payment cards and newspapers. The Visa payment system is open in the sense that any bank can join, but it is closed to nonbanks—particularly American Express. For newspapers, compatibility may seem impossible; a consumer reading one newspaper cannot see the advertisements in another newspaper. However, newspapers can pursue horizontal integration through merger. When the *New York Times* purchased the *Boston Globe,* one justification was the ability to sell newspaper advertisements throughout the northeastern United States. These joint sales represent a form of compatibility to the advertising buyer, who used to have to negotiate with two separate sellers. Also, media outlets can bundle sales without outright merger. For instance, Yellow Pages publishers maintain a trade association that sells advertisements in all books simultaneously with national campaigns.

支付卡和报纸领域的开放性非常重要。Visa支付系统在银行方面是开放的，任何银行都可以加入，但对非银行（尤其是美国运通）是封闭的。对于报纸而言，兼容性可能看似不可能实现；一个消费者阅读一份报纸无法看到另一份报纸中的广告。然而，报纸可以通过合并追求水平整合。当《纽约时报》收购《波士顿环球报》时，其中一个理由是能够在美国东北部地区销售报纸广告。这种联合销售形式对于广告买家来说具有兼容性，他们不再需要与两个独立的卖家进行谈判。此外，媒体机构可以通过捆绑销售而不是直接合并来实现兼容性。例如，黄页出版商维护一个贸易协会，在全国范围内与全国性广告活动同时销售广告。

Providers of platforms often prefer incompatibility on the grounds that it locks in current customers and locks out competitors. For instance, there has been no movement toward cross-brand compatibility in the video game market. But agents can circumvent incompatible platforms by using multiple platforms. A consumer that uses the Discover card cannot purchase from a store that only takes Visa, so many stores choose to accept both. Such actions can quickly undo any benefits that a platform may seek from resisting compatibility. In response, platforms encourage exclusive membership or usage. Payment cards use rewards programs to encourage exclusive usage on the part of consumers. Similarly, game console manufacturers will sometimes contract with developers to write exclusive games (Corts and Lederman, forthcoming; Lee, 2008). If one side of the market can be made exclusive, there is usually little reason to seek exclusivity on the other side. As argued above, if members of one side use only one platform at a time, the platform can charge monopoly prices to the other side for access.

平台提供商通常出于锁定现有客户和排斥竞争对手的考虑，更倾向于不兼容性。例如，在视频游戏市场上，并没有出现跨品牌兼容性的趋势。然而，主体可以通过使用多个平台来规避不兼容的情况。如果消费者使用Discover卡，就无法在只接受Visa的商店购物，因此很多商店选择同时接受两种卡。这样的做法很快就会抵消平台抵制兼容性所带来的任何好处。为了应对这种情况，平台鼓励独家会员或使用权。支付卡通过奖励计划鼓励消费者进行独家使用。类似地，游戏机制造商有时会与开发者签约开发独家游戏（Corts和Lederman, forthcoming; Lee, 2008）。如果市场一方能够实现独家化，通常就没有理由在另一方寻求独家化了。正如上文所述，如果一方成员一次只使用一个平台，则该平台可以向另一方收取垄断价格以获取接入权限。

What determines when markets with platform competition evolve to a "winnertake-all" standard, or when they evolve toward coexisting platforms, or when markets fail altogether? Here, I mention three possible issues that determine whether "tipping" occurs. First, if standards can differentiate from each other, they may be able to successfully coexist (Chou and Shy, 1990; Church and Gandal, 1992). Arguably, Apple and Microsoft operating systems have both survived by specializing in different markets: Microsoft in business and Apple in graphics and education. Magazines are an obvious example of platforms that differentiate in many dimensions and hence coexist.

在竞争激烈的平台市场中，何时会出现“赢者通吃”的标准，何时会出现共存的平台，以及何时市场会完全失败？这里，我提到了三个可能决定“倾斜”发生的问题。首先，如果不同标准能够彼此区分开来，它们有可能成功共存（Chou和Shy, 1990; Church和Gandal, 1992）。微软和苹果操作系统是一个明显的例子，它们通过专注于不同的市场领域而都得以生存：微软专注于商业领域，苹果则专注于图形和教育领域。杂志也是一个明显的例子，在许多方面有差异化的平台因此能够共存。

Second, tipping is less likely if agents can easily use multiple standards. Corts and Lederman (forthcoming) show that the fixed cost of producing a video game for one more standard have reduced over time relative to the overall fixed costs of producing a game, which has led to increased distribution of games across multiple game systems (for example, PlayStation, Nintendo, and Xbox) and a less-concentrated game system market.

其次，如果主体能够轻松使用多个标准，那么小费的可能性就较低。Corts和Lederman（即将发表）的研究表明，随着时间的推移，为适应另一个标准而生产一款视频游戏的固定成本相对于总体固定成本有所降低，这导致游戏在多个游戏系统（例如PlayStation、任天堂和Xbox）之间的分销增加，并且游戏系统市场变得更加分散。

Third, the ability of providers of complementary goods to differentiate themselves after picking a platform makes tipping more likely (Ellison and Fudenberg, 2003; Augereau, Greenstein, and Rysman, 2006). Hence, movie producers provide a differentiated product and so are willing to coordinate on the same standard, which was an element in the successful coordination on the VHS standard in the video cassette-recorder market. If the sellers cannot differentiate aside from adopting a standard, they must differentiate by choosing separate standards, which leads to the adoption of multiple standards (Ellison and Fudenberg, 2003) or even adoption failure (Augereau, Greenstein, and Rysman, 2006; Kretschmer, 2008). The lack of opportunities for differentiation is a common explanation for the failure of many websites that were meant to facilitate business-to-business sales. Sellers see little benefit to listing their services on a website in which they are placed in practically perfect competition. For example, Rust and Hall (2003) provide a quote from a steel broker in which the broker questions what he would gain from marketing himself through such a website. Firms that do participate in such websites turn out to be very creative in separating themselves from their competitors, for instance by withholding crucial information until the consumer has clicked from the platform website to the vendor website (Ellison and Ellison, 2009). Other Strategies Common strategies in one-sided markets like innovation, advertising, and quality investment can take on added dimensions in a two-sided market. I discuss such strategies briefly in this section, as well as some strategies that are specific to two-sided markets.

第三，互补商品供应商在选择平台后能够通过差异化来增加小费的可能性（Ellison和Fudenberg，2003年；Augereau、Greenstein和Rysman，2006年）。因此，电影制片商提供了一种有差异化的产品，并且愿意在同一个标准上进行协调，这是视频录像机市场上成功协调VHS标准的一个因素。如果卖方除了采用一个标准之外无法区分自己，则必须通过选择不同的标准来区分自己，这导致采用多个标准（Ellison和Fudenberg，2003年）甚至采用失败（Augereau、Greenstein和Rysman，2006年；Kretschmer，2008年）。缺乏区分机会是许多旨在促进企业间销售的网站失败的常见解释。卖方认为，在被置于实际完全竞争中的网站上列出他们的服务没有太大好处。例如，Rust和Hall（2003年）引用了一位钢铁经纪人对通过此类网站进行市场营销所获得的好处提出质疑。参与此类网站的公司事实证明非常善于与竞争对手区别开来, 例如直到消费者从平台网站点击到供应商网站之前才提供关键信息（Ellison和Ellison，2009年）。在双边市场中，除了常见的创新、广告和质量投资策略外，还存在其他策略。本节将简要讨论这些策略，以及一些特定于双边市场的策略。

Many businesses in two-sided markets rely on new technology, and so a primary concern for any such firm is how much to invest in innovation. Video game consoles have exhibited enormous technical progress, processing eight bits of information at a time in the mid-1980s as compared to 128 bits at a time in the most recent systems. Alongside direct improvement of the platform, firms that interact over the platform can innovate with their products. For instance, computational innovations allow game developers to leverage the technological architecture of any given gaming system into more attractive software. Progress in processing speed by consoles and associated programming techniques by developers explains the improvements in graphic quality and play experience in video games. In many examples, the platform firm and the providers of complements invest in the same issue. For instance, Visa invests in fraud prevention and so do member banks.

许多双边市场中的企业依赖新技术，因此对于这类企业来说，一个主要关注点是在创新方面的投资规模。视频游戏主机在技术上取得了巨大的进步，从20世纪80年代中期一次处理8位信息，到最新系统一次处理128位信息。除了直接改进平台本身之外，通过该平台进行互动的公司还可以通过其产品进行创新。例如，计算创新使游戏开发者能够充分利用任何给定游戏系统的技术架构来开发更具吸引力的软件。游戏主机处理速度的进步以及开发者采用的相关编程技术解释了视频游戏图形质量和游戏体验的改善。在许多情况下，平台公司和补充产品提供商都会对同一问题进行投资。例如，Visa投资于防止欺诈行为，成员银行也会进行类似投资。

Platform or intermediary firms recognize that their policies can affect the level of innovative investment by participating firms. In theory, a platform firm could subsidize improvements or offer discounts for improvements, but such an approach is unusual and hard to implement since the degree or existence of at least some improvements may be hard to verify. More commonly, the platform can shape the market structure in a way that encourages investment. For example, a platform can control market structure through fees, barriers to access, or the direct exclusion of some firms and thus affect incentives for innovation. The exact market structure that maximizes innovation is subject to a long debate (for instance, Aghion, Bloom, Blundell, Griffith, and Howitt, 2005). In the context of two-sided markets, Boudreau (2007) studies the market for operating systems for mobile devices such as personal digital assistants and cellular telephones. He argues that allowing a large number of software developers encouraged incremental innovation, but that large systemic innovation—such as that associated with a new version of the operating system—was better accomplished by operating systems with a relatively small set of software vendors. This point appears relevant for the many innovations associated with the largely technologically closed iPhone.

平台或中介公司认识到他们的政策可能会影响参与企业的创新投资水平。在理论上，平台公司可以对改进进行补贴或提供折扣，但这种方法很少见且难以实施，因为至少某些改进的程度或存在可能难以验证。更常见的是，平台可以通过费用、准入壁垒或直接排除某些企业来塑造市场结构，从而影响创新激励。关于最大化创新的确切市场结构存在长期争议（例如Aghion、Bloom、Blundell、Griffith和Howitt, 2005）。在双边市场背景下，Boudreau (2007)研究了移动设备操作系统（如个人数字助理和手机）的市场。他认为允许大量软件开发者参与鼓励渐进式创新，但大规模系统性创新（例如与操作系统新版本相关的创新）更适合由具有相对较小软件供应商集合的操作系统来完成。这一观点似乎与主要技术封闭的iPhone相关联的许多创新有关。

Other important strategic choices are advertising and quality. While these have been well studied in one-sided markets, they become newly interesting in a twosided market because the choice on one side of the market affects the price on the other. What would be the effects of advertising? Advertising on one side raises participation and usage on that side, which raises demand on the other side, and so advertising on one side can lead to higher prices on the other. In addition, there is a more subtle effect through mark-ups: advertising to one side that raises the mark-up on that side leads to lower prices on the other side, and vice versa. For instance, suppose that advertising to consumers by Sony for the PlayStation 3 raises sales. As a result, demand by game developers increases, which allows Sony to increase royalties it collects from developers. However, suppose that the advertising also causes consumers to be less price sensitive and hence causes Sony to increase the price to consumers further. As a result, the benefits of attracting a game developer are higher since the resulting consumers are more valuable, which causes Sony to lower the royalty rate, or at least moderate the increase that came from higher demand. If advertising had attracted more price-sensitive consumers, the effect would have been to *raise* the royalty rate an additional amount.

在双边市场中，广告和质量是其他重要的战略选择。虽然在单边市场中已经对此进行了深入研究，但在双边市场中，这些选择变得更加有趣，因为市场一侧的选择会影响到另一侧的价格。那么广告会产生什么效果呢？在一侧进行广告宣传会提高该侧的参与度和使用率，从而增加对另一侧的需求，因此一侧的广告宣传可能导致另一侧的价格上涨。此外，还存在着通过利润率产生更微妙影响的情况：对某一方进行广告宣传提高了该方面的利润率，从而导致另一方面降低价格，反之亦然。例如，假设索尼向消费者进行PlayStation 3游戏机的广告宣传增加了销售量。结果是游戏开发者对其需求增加，这使得索尼能够增加从开发者那里收取的版税。然而，假设广告也导致消费者对价格不那么敏感，并进一步导致索尼进一步提高消费者价格。结果是吸引游戏开发者带来更多好处，因为由此产生的消费者更有价值，这使得索尼降低版税率，或者至少减缓了由于需求增加而带来的提高。如果广告吸引了更多价格敏感的消费者，效果将是额外提高版税率。

We often distinguish between "persuasive" advertising that raises the utility of all consumers for a product and "informative" advertising that informs consumers about a product's existence or features. Persuasive advertising most often increases the mark-up a firm may charge by raising utility, whereas informative advertising can reduce the mark-up by attracting relatively low-demand consumers. Thus, persuasive advertising on one side can lead to lower prices on the other side, whereas informative advertising on one side leads to higher prices on the other. Similarly, the effects of quality investment will depend on whether it generates relatively price-elastic or -inelastic consumers on the margin, and on whether it attracts consumers that are more or less responsive to participation on the other side.

我们通常将广告分为“说服性广告”和“信息性广告”。前者提高了所有消费者对产品的效用，后者则向消费者介绍产品的存在或特点。通过提高效用，说服性广告通常会增加企业可以收取的溢价；而通过吸引需求相对较低的消费者，信息性广告则可能降低溢价。因此，一方面的说服性广告可能导致另一方面的价格下降，而一方面的信息性广告可能导致另一方面的价格上涨。同样地，质量投资的效果将取决于它是否吸引了对参与反应较大或较小的消费者，并且取决于它是否产生了相对价格弹性或不弹性较大的消费者。

Also, a platform firm must be concerned not only with its own quality and advertising, but also that of the vendors who operate over its network. For instance, a franchisor operates a two-sided market in the sense that it attracts consumers to its brand and franchisees to operate outlets—similar to how an operating system attracts consumers and software vendors. Franchising contracts typically specify numerous "investments" in advertising and quality, such as advertising by the franchisor and cleanliness, and possibly also local advertising, by the franchisee.

此外，一个平台公司不仅需要关注自身的质量和广告，还需要关注在其网络上运营的供应商的质量和广告。举例来说，特许经营商在某种程度上运营着一个双边市场，吸引消费者购买其品牌产品，并吸引特许经营者开设门店——类似于操作系统吸引消费者和软件供应商。特许经营合同通常规定了广告和质量方面的多项“投资”，例如由特许经营商进行的广告宣传以及由特许经营者进行的清洁工作，可能还包括地方性广告宣传。

Certain more subtle strategies are more common in two-sided than in onesided markets. In some markets, the platform controls the way suppliers are presented to consumers, and the platform can make it easier or more difficult to search and switch across firms (Hagiu and Julien, 2008). For instance, a web portal presenting multiple sellers of a given product may or may not present the shipping costs associated with the purchase. In other markets, the seller controls how platforms are presented to consumers. For instance, Visa limits the ability of merchants to promote other payment types (like debit cards). In operating systems, an issue in the Microsoft antitrust case was Microsoft's control of the appearance of the desktop and the place that Microsoft's browser had in it.

在双边市场中，比单边市场更常见的是一些更为微妙的策略。在某些市场上，平台对供应商向消费者展示的方式进行控制，从而影响消费者搜索和切换不同公司的难易程度（Hagiu和Julien，2008）。例如，一个展示特定产品多个卖家的网络门户可能选择性地显示与购买相关的运费。而在其他市场上，卖家则控制着平台向消费者展示的方式。例如，Visa限制了商家推广其他支付方式（如借记卡）的能力。在操作系统领域，微软反垄断案中一个问题是微软对桌面外观以及其浏览器所处位置的控制权。

重写后:
在双边市场中，相较于单边市场，更常见一些更为微妙的策略。在某些市场上，平台对供应商向消费者展示方式进行控制，并且平台可以通过影响搜索和切换不同公司的难易程度来使之变得更加容易或困难（Hagiu和Julien, 2008）。举例来说，在一个呈现给定产品多个卖家的网络门户上可能会有选择地呈现与购买相关联的运费信息。而在其他市场上，卖家则对平台向消费者展示方式进行控制。例如，Visa限制了商家推广其他支付方式（如借记卡）的能力。在操作系统领域，微软反垄断案中一个问题是微软对桌面外观以及其浏览器所处位置的控制权。

The organization of the platform firm itself offers one more set of strategic choices. In many cases, the platform firm takes on the standard corporate form owned by investors; examples include Microsoft, Sony, and most newspapers. But in a surprising number of cases, the platform firm is owned by market participants. For instance, Visa and Mastercard were until recently associations of member banks. Similarly, the Multiple Listing Service, which must attract housing buyers and sellers, is a cooperative owned by real estate agents. The American Society of Composers, Artists and Publishers (ASCAP) mediates between music producers and music users (such as radio stations) and is an association of music producers. The type of organization greatly affects public policy toward the entities. When large platform corporations run into accusations of anticompetitive behavior, it typically involves charges of monopolization. In contrast, associations often face questions about whether internal policies facilitate collusion. An interesting challenge is to predict which markets will organize in which ways, and the consequences of their choices.

平台公司本身的组织形式提供了另一组战略选择。在许多情况下，平台公司采用投资者拥有的标准公司形式，例如微软、索尼和大多数报纸。但是令人惊讶的是，在相当多的情况下，平台公司由市场参与者拥有。例如，Visa和Mastercard直到最近都是成员银行协会。同样，必须吸引住房买卖双方的Multiple Listing Service是由房地产经纪人拥有的合作社。美国作曲家、艺术家和出版商协会（ASCAP）在音乐制作人和音乐使用者（如广播电台）之间进行调解，并且是音乐制作人协会。组织类型极大地影响对这些实体的公共政策。当大型平台企业被指控存在反竞争行为时，通常涉及垄断指控。相比之下，协会经常面临内部政策是否促进勾结的问题。一个有趣的挑战是预测哪些市场将以何种方式组织，并且他们选择所带来后果。

## Public Policy



The economics of two-sided markets are important for a wide variety of public policy issues. In this section, I discuss the impact on some parts of antitrust and regulation, and discuss some important cases. Antitrust Two-sided markets typically have network effects and as such are likely to tip toward a single dominant platform. As a result, it is not surprising that these markets are of interest to antitrust authorities. Given that pricing can look very different in two- than in one-sided markets, it is important that authorities can properly evaluate the outcomes we observe.

两边市场的经济学对于各种公共政策问题至关重要。在本节中，我将探讨其对反垄断和监管的影响，并讨论一些重要案例。由于两边市场通常具有网络效应，因此很可能会向单一主导平台倾斜。因此，反垄断机构对这些市场的兴趣也就不足为奇了。考虑到定价在双边市场和单边市场中可能存在显著差异，因此当局能够正确评估我们所观察到的结果就显得尤为重要。

The economics of two-sided markets provides insights primarily into pricing and so is likely to be particularly important for the parts of antitrust enforcement that focus on pricing issues. For instance, there is a growing interest in using merger simulations to evaluate the impact of mergers on prices and outcomes. Naturally, if we were to analyze the merger between two platform firms, we would need to account for complex two-sided issues that arise. For example, consider that the Department of Justice has allowed for joint operating agreements between competing newspapers in some towns, which allows for joint price-setting but with independent editorial control. Evaluating such an agreement requires an analysis of how prices to both consumers and advertisers will change, which are interrelated. In Rysman (2004), I offer another example with Yellow Pages directories.

两边市场的经济学主要关注定价问题，因此在反垄断执法中，对于关注定价问题的部分尤为重要。例如，越来越多人对使用合并模拟评估合并对价格和结果的影响感兴趣。如果我们要分析两个平台公司之间的合并，就需要考虑到涉及到复杂的双边问题。举例来说，美国司法部曾允许在某些城镇竞争报纸之间进行联合运营协议，这允许进行联合定价但保持独立编辑控制。评估这样一项协议需要分析消费者和广告商的价格将如何变化，并且它们是相互关联的。在Rysman（2004）中，我提供了另一个黄页目录的例子。

Merger analysis balances the market power and cost reductions created by a merger. In a two-sided market, if the merger reduces cost on one side, that has implications for price on the other side. Also, a merger could increase market power on both sides of the market and still lead to a price decline on one side. An alternative evaluative tool to merger simulation is to use regression analysis: for instance, regressing price on the number of firms in a market. In a two-sided market, we should consider multiple prices and, potentially, different measures of competition for each side. For example, newspapers compete with billboards for advertising, but not for consumer readership. Video games compete with a host of leisure activities for consumer attention, but not for game developer attention. In Rysman (2007b), I discuss these issues further.

合并分析旨在平衡合并所带来的市场力量和成本降低。在双边市场中，如果合并降低了一方的成本，那么这将对另一方的价格产生影响。此外，合并可能会增加市场两侧的市场力量，并且仍然可能导致一方价格下降。除了合并模拟评估之外，回归分析是另一种可行的评估工具：例如，通过将价格与市场中公司数量进行回归分析。在双边市场中，我们应该考虑多个价格，并且可能为每一方使用不同的竞争度量标准。例如，报纸与广告牌竞争广告资源，但不与消费者读者竞争。视频游戏与各种休闲活动竞争消费者注意力，但不与游戏开发者注意力竞争。在Rysman（2007b）中进一步讨论了这些问题。

At a more fundamental level, determining the relevant market is a crucial ingredient in constructing most antitrust cases. Antitrust authorities typically use the size of cross-price elasticities to determine what products should be included in a relevant market. If two-sidedness is important, we must account for the endogenous variation in other prices in response to any one price. For instance, suppose we consider whether a price increase to consumers using platform A causes consumers to switch to platform B, which would place the platforms in the same market. We must recognize that the response by A's consumers will also affect participation of A's sellers, which may affect the sellers that B sees and lead to an effect on B's consumers over and above the standard substitution effect from A's consumer price change. Evans and Noel (2005) explore this issue in greater detail.

在构建大多数反垄断案件中，确定相关市场是一个更为基本的问题。反垄断机构通常使用交叉价格弹性的大小来确定应该将哪些产品纳入相关市场。如果双边性很重要，我们必须考虑其他价格对任何一个价格的内生变化。例如，假设我们要考虑当平台A向消费者提高价格时，是否会导致消费者转向平台B，从而将这两个平台置于同一市场中。我们必须认识到A的消费者的反应也会影响到A的卖家参与度，这可能会影响到B所看到的卖家，并导致B的消费者产生超过标准替代效应之外的效应，即来自于A消费者价格变化。Evans和Noel（2005）对此问题进行了更详细地探讨。

[请注意：以上重写结果仅供参考，请根据实际情况进行修改和调整]

Several other areas of antitrust analysis use price behavior intensively. For instance, computing damages often involves computing counterfactual prices, such as the price that would have arisen if firms had not colluded. Such a computation could easily be influenced by whether a market is two-sided or not. Similarly, the design of remedies for antitrust violations might be affected. For instance, a judge would probably not want to break up a platform into its constituent parts. Evans (2003) provides a more complete discussion of twosided markets and antitrust.

反垄断分析的其他领域也广泛运用价格行为。例如，在计算损害赔偿时，通常需要计算反事实价格，即如果企业没有串通作恶，价格将会如何。这种计算很容易受到市场是否为双边市场的影响。同样地，反垄断违规行为的补救措施设计可能会受到影响。例如，法官可能不愿意将一个平台拆分成其组成部分。Evans（2003）对双边市场和反垄断问题进行了更全面的讨论。

It seems clear that the economics of two-sided markets is highly relevant for pricing analysis in antitrust. But that does not mean that it is important for all aspects of antitrust analysis. Although inefficient pricing is the hallmark of the economic criticism of monopoly power, inefficient pricing is not an antitrust violation by itself. Monopolization and vertical contracting cases typically hinge on whether a firm has excluded competitors from the market in a way that did not benefit consumers or reduce costs. The actual prices charged in such a situation are seen as incidental, and without entry barriers, transient in the face of competition. That is, determining the difference between optimal and equilibrium prices has little role in establishing the legality of an action in a monopolization case (although it may have an important role in determining the requisite question of whether a firm has market power). Still, one could well imagine that two-sided market economics could make a contribution here. For instance, exclusive dealing enforces usage of a single platform. In our discussion of the strategy of pricing, we saw that when agents on one side use a single platform in a multi-platform context, price competition between platforms is particularly intense on that side. Similarly, tying the purchase of one product to the purchase of another may allow for a form of price discrimination, which increases value extraction on one side and, in a two-sided market, leads to lower prices on the other. Thus, exclusive dealing and tying potentially have added benefits in a two-sided market that might be important counterpoints to the standard antitrust criticism that they may create entry barriers.5
As a concrete example of where two-sided markets seem to matter and where they do not, consider interchange fees, which (as discussed earlier) determine how much revenue a consumer's bank collects from a merchant's bank on any transaction. The interchange fee is set collectively by member banks, which raises questions about collusion. This issue is governed by the treatment of joint ventures, in which collective action is legal if the joint venture is necessary to make a product available, since more products are presumed to make a market more competitive.

双边市场经济学在反垄断定价分析中显然具有重要意义，但并不意味着它在反垄断分析的所有方面都同等重要。尽管低效定价是对垄断权力的经济批评的典型特征，但低效定价本身并不构成反垄断违规行为。垄断和纵向合同案件通常取决于企业是否以一种对消费者无益或未降低成本的方式排除了竞争对手。在这种情况下，实际价格被视为次要因素，并且在没有进入壁垒、面临竞争时会很短暂。换句话说，在建立一个垄断案件中，确定最优价格和均衡价格之间的差异对于确定行动是否合法起到较小作用（尽管它可能在确定企业是否具有市场力量的必要问题上起到重要作用）。然而，我们可以想象双边市场经济学可能在此方面做出贡献。例如，独家交易强制使用单一平台。我们在定价策略讨论中看到，在多平台环境中，当一方主体使用单一平台时，该方面之间的价格竞争尤为激烈。类似地，将一种产品的购买与另一种产品的购买绑定可能会导致一种形式的价格歧视，这增加了一方面的价值提取，并在双边市场中导致了更低的价格。因此，在双边市场中，独家交易和绑定可能具有额外的好处，这可能是标准反垄断批评所不能忽视的重要对策。作为一个具体例子，我们可以考虑交换费用，它决定消费者银行从商家银行在任何交易中收取多少收入（如前文所述）。交换费用由成员银行共同设定，这引发了关于勾结问题的质疑。这个问题由合资企业的处理方式来管理，在合资企业是为了使产品可得性而必需时，集体行动是合法的，因为更多的产品被认为会使市场更具竞争力。

The U.S. antitrust case that dealt most directly with these issues is National Bancard Corp.(Nabanco) v. Visa U.S.A., Inc. (779 F.2d 592 [11th Cir. 1986]). In the court's view, the alternative to the collective setting of the interchange fee was to have independent bilateral negotiation between banks serving merchants and consumers, in which case, consumers and merchants must know whether their banks had an agreement before attempting a payment. The court deemed that system unworkable, and hence the collectively set interchange fee was legal as it was necessary to provide the Visa card.

在涉及这些问题的美国反垄断案中，最直接的是National Bancard Corp.(Nabanco) v. Visa U.S.A., Inc. (779 F.2d 592 [11th Cir. 1986])。法院认为，与银行为商家和消费者提供服务进行独立的双边谈判相比，集体设定交换费用是一种可行的替代方案。在前一种情况下，消费者和商家必须在付款前了解他们的银行是否有协议。然而，法院认为这种系统不可行，因此集体设定的交换费用是合法的，因为它对于提供Visa卡是必要的。

In this paper, I do not seek to reargue or revisit the question of whether the interchange fee should be treated as an anticompetitive violation. Rather I wish to draw attention to the ambiguous role of the economics of two-sided markets. On one hand, the court recognized the value of a centralized platform for payments. Also, its final decision may have been influenced by the idea of the potential efficiency of an interchange fee in a two-sided market. However, the technical legal question was about cooperation and the nature of the Visa association, not about two-sided markets. Once the court established that setting an interchange fee is legal, it did not inquire into whether Visa set the optimal interchange fee. Hence, the price-measurement issues associated with two-sided markets had a limited role.

本文旨在探讨双边市场经济学的模糊角色，而非重新争论或回顾交换费是否应被视为反竞争行为的问题。法院一方面认识到了支付集中平台的价值，同时其最终决定可能受到在双边市场中交换费用潜在效率的影响。然而，技术上的法律问题是关于合作和Visa协会性质，并非关于双边市场。一旦法院确认设定交换费用是合法的，它并未调查Visa是否设定了最优交换费用。因此，在与双边市场相关联的价格衡量问题上发挥了有限作用。

This approach contrasts with a similar case in Europe. In December 2007, the European Commission ruled that the interchange fee at MasterCard (for crossborder transaction) is collusive and illegal. Why this difference? The EC considered the alternative to a jointly set interchange fee to be an interchange fee that was regulated to be zero (rather than bilateral negotiations). Since MasterCard can exist with a zero-interchange fee, the exemption to the joint behavior was eliminated. However, in making the decision, the EC explicitly recognized that a zero-interchange fee is probably not optimal, a point that can be derived from models of two-sided markets. Moreover, the EC stated that a comprehensive study of the market establishing the efficiency of MasterCard interchange rates would be a sufficient defense. Although conducting such a study is a daunting prospect, it would clearly involve two-sided issues. Hence, two-sided market issues become important when the court includes price computations in questions of legality. For a more comprehensive discussion of international policy toward payment cards, see Weiner and Wright (2005) and Bradford and Hayashi (2008).

这种方法与欧洲的一个类似案例形成鲜明对比。在2007年12月，欧洲委员会裁定MasterCard（用于跨境交易）的交换费是勾结和非法的。为什么会有这种差异？欧盟委员会认为，与共同设定的交换费相比，另一种选择是将交换费规定为零（而不是进行双边谈判）。由于MasterCard可以在零交换费的情况下继续运营，因此取消了联合行为的豁免权。然而，在做出决定时，欧盟委员会明确承认零交换费可能并非最优选择，这一点可以从双边市场模型中推导出来。此外，欧盟委员会还表示，进行一项全面研究以确定MasterCard交换费率的效率将足以作为辩护理由。尽管进行这样的研究是一个艰巨的任务，但它显然涉及到双边问题。因此，在法院将价格计算纳入合法性问题时，双边市场问题变得重要起来。有关国际支付卡政策更全面讨论，请参阅Weiner和Wright（2005）以及Bradford和Hayashi（2008）。

The famous case that the U.S. Department of Justice brought against Microsoft also exemplifies these issues. As is standard in monopolization cases, the government first attempted to establish that Microsoft had market power. Here, pricing issues were crucial and two-sided market concerns were relatively important. For instance, Microsoft argued that its price was well below what a monopoly would charge given reasonable assumptions on demand and marginal cost. The government countered that much of the profit was collected in the applications market, which is an issue involving two-sided markets. However, once market power was established, the case hinged on whether tying the browser to the operating system created an entry barrier into the operating system market. The importance of two-sided markets here is ambiguous. The government claimed that Microsoft's motivation for tying relied on two-sided thinking: Microsoft's tie reduced Netscape's importance, which prevented Netscape from easily entering the operating systems market with a compatible browser. However, the legal issue was to compare the consumer benefits from Microsoft's integrated product to the losses resulting from a weakened Netscape. Pricing was not a primary issue in this calculation, and it is unclear that two-sided market economics offers much guidance.

美国司法部对微软提起的著名案例也展示了这些问题。在垄断案件中，政府首先试图证明微软具有市场力量。在这方面，定价问题至关重要，而双边市场的关注相对重要。例如，微软辩称其价格远低于根据合理假设对需求和边际成本进行计算的垄断者所收取的价格。政府反驳说，大部分利润是在应用市场中收集的，这涉及到双边市场的问题。然而，一旦确立了市场力量，案件就取决于将浏览器与操作系统捆绑是否构成进入操作系统市场的壁垒。在这里，双边市场的重要性是模糊不清的。政府声称微软捆绑浏览器的动机依赖于双边思维：微软的捆绑减少了Netscape的重要性，阻止了Netscape通过兼容浏览器轻松进入操作系统市场。然而，在法律问题上需要比较微软整合产品带来的消费者利益与因削弱Netscape而导致的损失。定价并不是这个计算中主要考虑的问题，并且目前尚不清楚双边市场经济学能提供多少指导。

In general, my prediction is that two-sided analysis will grow in importance in areas where pricing analysis is important, whereas the effect will be more limited in exclusionary conduct cases such as monopolization and conditional sales. Regulation Pricing issues are the main thrust of a great deal of economic regulation, and as such, the economics of two-sided markets can make a large contribution. Classic price regulation involved large regulatory commissions with research staffs trying to measure marginal cost and demand in an attempt to determine optimal prices. One could imagine such a staff attempting to determine optimal prices in a two-sided market as well, where the staff would have to investigate demand and cross-price elasticities on both sides, as well as cost.6
If there is no antitrust violation in setting interchange fees but the equilibrium outcome diverges from the social optimum (as in Rochet and Tirole, 2002), then price regulation may be a reasonable solution. Several countries have followed this approach. In Australia, legislation supports the direct determination of the interchange fee at bank associations (Visa and Mastercard) by the Reserve Bank of Australia. Numerous other countries have moved in this direction.

一般而言，我预测在定价分析重要的领域，双边分析将变得更加重要，而在垄断和条件销售等排除行为案件中，其影响将相对有限。监管定价问题是许多经济监管的核心内容，因此，双边市场经济学可以做出重要贡献。传统的价格监管涉及由研究人员组成的大型监管委员会，试图通过衡量边际成本和需求来确定最优价格。我们可以想象这样一个团队也尝试在双边市场中确定最优价格，在这种情况下，该团队需要调查两个方面的需求和交叉价格弹性以及成本。

如果在设置互换费用时没有反垄断违规行为但均衡结果与社会最优解不一致（如Rochet和Tirole, 2002所述），那么定价监管可能是一个合理的解决方案。许多国家已经采取了这种方法。在澳大利亚，法律支持澳大利亚储备银行直接确定银行协会（Visa和Mastercard）的互换费用。其他许多国家也朝着这个方向发展。

Economic theory suggests that any determination of the optimal interchange fee should consider the marginal costs of serving both consumers and merchants as well as price elasticities of demand and interaction elasticities of demand to usage on the other side of the market. Further considerations might be the government (or total social) costs of alternative payment systems that consumers would use. For instance, cash is more costly to process than credit card payments, whereas electronic debit is cheaper (Reserve Bank of Australia, 2007). In fact, the Reserve Bank of Australia (2006) sets interchange fees based on the average cost of banks serving consumers (as explained at http://www.rba.gov.au/MediaReleases/2006/Pdf/
mr_06_02_creditcard_standard.pdf ). The interchange fees imposed in Australia may or may not raise social welfare, but the process for determining the fee surely diverges from the prescription of the economics of two-sided markets. The economics of two-sided markets can play an important role in guiding the determination of the optimal fee, although it does not appear to have done so to date.

根据经济理论，确定最佳互换费用应综合考虑为消费者和商家提供服务的边际成本，以及市场另一侧需求的价格弹性和交互弹性。此外，还应考虑消费者使用替代支付系统所带来的政府（或总体社会）成本。例如，现金处理成本高于信用卡支付，而电子借记卡则更为廉价（澳大利亚储备银行，2007年）。实际上，澳大利亚储备银行根据银行为消费者提供服务的平均成本来设定互换费用（详见http://www.rba.gov.au/MediaReleases/2006/Pdf/mr_06_02_creditcard_standard.pdf）。澳大利亚所施加的互换费用可能会对社会福利产生影响，但该费用确定过程与两边市场经济学的建议存在差异。尽管如此，两边市场经济学在指导确定最佳费用方面仍具有重要作用，尽管迄今为止尚未得到充分应用。

An interesting contrast in the treatment of banking fees is in the market for automated teller machines. A network of ATMs is two-sided in the sense that it is more valuable to consumers if it can reach more banks and more valuable to banks if more consumers use it, which is often a function of how many locations a network reaches. While early networks of ATMs were proprietary, banks recognized the value of compatibility early on, and formed networks that served groups of banks. These often involved interchange fees, so that the consumer's bank paid the owner of the ATM for each transaction. In addition, the owner of the ATM could charge a consumer a surcharge for using the machine. These surcharges were federally regulated to zero early in the industry's development but were deregulated in 1996. What followed was a massive increase in the number of ATMs. Knittel and Stango (2008) argue that deregulating surcharges for ATMs had a major role in causing the expansion. Hence, fees were deregulated in this market, in contrast with the current trend toward regulation in payment cards. Furthermore, increased prices led to more consumer usage rather than less because ATMs were much more conveniently located.

自动取款机市场对银行费用的处理方式呈现出有趣的对比。自动取款机网络是一个双边市场，如果能够覆盖更多的银行，对消费者来说就更有价值；而对银行来说，如果能够吸引更多的消费者使用该网络，也会增加其价值，这往往与网络覆盖范围有关。早期的自动取款机网络是专有的，但银行很早就意识到兼容性的价值，并形成了为一组银行提供服务的网络。这些网络通常涉及互换费用，即消费者所在的银行会为每笔交易向自动取款机所有者支付费用。此外，自动取款机所有者还可以向消费者收取使用该设备的附加费。尽管在该行业发展初期，这些附加费被联邦政府管制为零，但在1996年进行了解除管制。随之而来的是自动取款机数量大幅增加。Knittel和Stango（2008）认为解除对自动取款机附加费管制在推动其扩张方面起到了重要作用。因此，在这个市场上实施了解除管制政策，与当前支付卡领域趋向于监管相反。此外，价格上涨导致消费者使用量增加而不是减少，因为自动取款机的位置更加便利。

## Conclusion



The literature on two-sided markets is developing rapidly. To this point, the major focus of the economic research on two-sided markets has been to address how the intermediary (or "the platform") sets prices for both sides of the market simultaneously. A great deal more could be done on this topic. Less well studied are a number of other important choices, like the choice over how open to be, or how many sides of the market to allow. The literature has important policy implications for pricing analysis, an important feature of regulation and a large part of antitrust analysis.

双边市场的文献正在迅速发展。迄今为止，经济学对双边市场的主要研究重点是如何同时为市场两个方面（即中介或“平台”）制定价格。然而，这个领域还有很多待探索的问题。其他一些重要选择，如开放程度和允许多少个市场方面，尚未得到充分研究。这些文献对于定价分析具有重要的政策意义，也是监管和反垄断分析的重要组成部分。
