# An Agent-Based Approach To Evaluate The Impact Of Economic Dismissals Facilitation On The French Labor Market




# Short Version 05/10/2016 (Corrected - 15/03/2017)



Abstract. The El Khomri law (also called "Work law") has triggered a lot of conflicting judgements among French economists in 2016. However no model has been used to evaluate its effects ex ante. We have developed over the past 10 years a calibrated agent-based model of the French labor market, in order understand better such a complex system, and do policy analysis and design. The model integrates the heterogeneity of agents, and their decisions (firms and workers) based on a search theoretical framework to generate gross flows. It gives rational microeconomic foundations to behavior, albeit with decision rules using bounded rationality rather than optimal rules in an equilibrium with rational expectations which would not make sense in such a complex system. Instead agents form anticipations based both on their own history and a detailed algorithm is developed to model the firms'computation of expected intertemporal profits for different scenarios of future own demand, with the possibility of loss aversion, to decide on hiring or not, and the type of labor contracts. We introduce several main institutions of the labor market and specially the two main labor contracts, Open-Ended contracts and Fixed Term Contracts. The WorkSim model simulates the gross flows between inactivity, unemployment and these two types of employment, with a consistent accounting system. It is calibrated by a powerful algorithm to set 63 parameters in order to fit 64 aggregate real variables. The calibration reveals an important loss aversion on part of firms, which is determinant of the hiring decisions. If we experiment with a low loss aversion, the unemployment diminishes by several points. We then analyze the facilitation of the economic dismissals allowed by the El Khomri law. We find that it has little effect on global unemployment but benefits the young who crowd out the seniors. This result is based on the substitution by the employers of Open Ended Contracts which become more precarious to Fixed Duration Contracts which become less useful, and the fact that young workers are more often in Fixed Term Contracts than the other age categories. The labor market is very deeply transformed in terms of flows also. When aggregate demand is endogenously changed, the experiment shows that the employment and the unemployment react more strongly than before the law, yielding a higher aggregate flexibility.

摘要。2016年，法国的“埃尔·科姆里法”（也称为“劳动法”）在法国经济学家之间引发了许多争议。然而，尚未使用模型对其效果进行事前评估。过去10年中，我们开发了一个经过校准的基于主体的法国劳动力市场模型，以更好地理解这个复杂系统，并进行政策分析和设计。该模型将主体的异质性和决策（企业和工人）整合到一个搜索理论框架中，以生成总体流动。它为行为提供了合理的微观经济基础，尽管决策规则使用有限理性而不是在具有合理预期均衡的复杂系统中使用最优规则是没有意义的。相反，主体根据自身历史和详细算法形成预期跨时期利润来模拟企业对未来自身需求不同情景下预期利润的计算，并考虑损失厌恶程度来决定是否雇佣以及劳动合同类型。我们介绍了劳动力市场的几个主要机构，特别是两种主要劳动合同：无固定期限合同和固定期限合同。WorkSim模型模拟了不活动、失业和这两种就业类型之间的总体流动，并具有一致的会计系统。通过强大的算法校准，该模型设置了63个参数以适应64个总体实际变量。校准结果显示，企业存在重要的损失厌恶，这对雇佣决策起到决定性作用。如果我们尝试较低的损失厌恶程度，失业率将下降数个百分点。然后我们分析了埃尔·科姆里法允许的经济解雇便利化措施。我们发现它对全球失业率影响不大，但对年轻人有利，他们排挤了老年人。这一结果基于雇主将无固定期限合同替换为更加不稳定的固定期限合同，并且年轻工人比其他年龄段更常签订固定期限合同。劳动力市场在流动方面也发生了非常深刻的转变。当总需求内生性地改变时，实验表明就业和失业比法律出台前更强烈地反应，从而产生更高的总体灵活性。

## 1 Introduction


The El Khomri law project also called "Work" law has recently set the war not only on the French political scene, with many demonstrations and strikes, and a severe divide between the Left, it has also triggered a ﬁght between prominent French economists who have taken very strong positions either for or against it [?,?]. However the French labor market is a complex system, and any new law is likely to spurt reactions by the agents, namely heterogeneous ﬁrms and heterogeneous workers and persons who might enter/quit the labor market, and the mobility ﬂows, hires, ﬁres and many other ﬂows may generate opposed eﬀects. The net consequences for employment, unemployment and participation may depend on the empirical strengths of these diﬀerent eﬀects. The categories of manpower are also likely impacted diﬀerently. Over the past years, we have developed a model of the French labor market as a complex system, with many interactions, in order to understand better how it functions, with the guiding idea that heterogeneity is key and institutions mediate the ﬁnal eﬀects. The objective is then to assess policy projects, an ex-ante analysis. Among achievements, the model has the ability to uncover particularly crowding out eﬀects, a phenomenon diﬃcult to evaluate ex-ante but a crucial one. We have described some of these complexities of the labor market policies for a previous reform called the "Generation Contract" in [?], and shown that even if ﬁrms had hired on this contract up to the limit set by the program, the unemployment would have decreased by a very modest 30,000 due not only to the windfall eﬀect which is widely mentioned, but also spells in the subsidized jobs much shorter than those computed without a model, and some crowding out that we measure.


引言


法国的El Khomri法案，也被称为“劳动”法案，最近不仅在法国政坛上引发了争议，引发了许多示威和罢工，还在左翼内部造成了严重的分裂。它还引发了法国著名经济学家之间的争执，他们对该法案持强烈的支持或反对立场。然而，法国的劳动市场是一个复杂的系统，任何新法律都可能引发代理人即异质性企业和异质性工人以及可能进入/退出劳动市场的人的反应，以及流动性流动、招聘、解雇和许多其他流动可能产生相反的效果。就业、失业和参与的净后果可能取决于这些不同效果的实证强度。不同的人力资源类别也可能受到不同的影响。在过去几年中，我们开发了一个关于法国劳动市场的模型，将其视为一个复杂系统，通过许多相互作用来更好地理解其运作方式，其指导思想是异质性是关键，机构介入最终效果。其目标是对政策项目进行评估，进行事前分析。该模型的一个成就是能够揭示特别是挤出效应，这是一个难以事先评估但却至关重要的现象。我们在之前的一项名为“世代合同”的改革中描述了劳动力市场政策的一些复杂性，并显示即使企业根据该计划设定的上限进行了招聘，由于不仅仅是广泛提及的不劳而获效应，还有补贴工作的时间远短于未使用模型计算的时间，以及我们测量的一些挤出效应，失业人数也仅会减少大约30,000人。

We are then puzzled by the ﬂat statements on the El-Khomri law mentioned above. Some of the predictions are based on the Spanish and the Italian evolution of employment and unemployment after the labor market reforms in these countries, but the simple observation of an improvement in employment cannot be used to prove that the reform has had an impact. The state of the art in econometrics requires that there is a natural experiment, i.e. that the reform has been applied to only to a part of the workers in a country, and comparison is then made controlling for the heterogeneity between the treated and the untreated part. This is not the case, and it will be close to impossible to evaluate Matteo Renzi’s Job Act as well as the present law ex-post, since the observed eﬀect can be caused by an external demand shock or other causes. Although the previous criticism is suﬃcient, we will emphasize that there are plenty of institutional and other diﬀerences which matter. The facilitation of dismissals from Open Ended Contracts (OEC) in the El-Khomri law does not take the form of lower severance pay but of shorter delays before dismissals which can be legally implemented. Another essential point is the legislation on the temporary jobs, and specially the Fixed Term Contracts (FTC) which may appear as substitutes to the Open Ended Contracts, the ﬁrst aﬀected by an facilitation of the dismissals in the El-Khomri law. Although many countries have such jobs, the legislation is diﬀerent between France and the mentioned countries.

我们对上述提到的El-Khomri法案的断然言论感到困惑。其中一些预测是基于西班牙和意大利在这些国家的劳动市场改革后就业和失业的发展情况，但仅仅观察到就业状况的改善并不能用来证明改革产生了影响。在计量经济学的最新研究中，需要有一个自然实验，即改革仅适用于一个国家的部分工人，并在控制了受影响部分和未受影响部分之间的异质性后进行比较。这并非如此，而且事后评估Matteo Renzi的就业法案以及当前的法律几乎是不可能的，因为观察到的效果可能是由外部需求冲击或其他原因造成的。尽管之前的批评已经足够，我们还要强调存在大量的制度和其他差异。El-Khomri法案中对无固定期合同(OEC)解雇的便利化并不是通过降低遣散费来实现，而是通过缩短可以合法实施解雇的延迟。另一个重要点是关于临时工作的立法，特别是固定期合同(FTC)，这可能看起来是对无固定期合同的替代品，后者是El-Khomri法案中便利化解雇的首要影响对象。尽管许多国家都有此类工作，但法国和上述国家的立法不同。

In fact our modeling the successive  versions of the El-Khomri law has shown some diﬀerences in the results, and short run and long run eﬀects may diﬀer. Statements should then be backed by a full model of the labor market ﬂows with the old and then the new law integrated in it, to get an understanding of the mechanisms by which the change in the law can have eﬀects. We argue that the details of the legislation matter (see [?] along the same line of criticism). Econometric analysis of reforms, in order to side step the unavailability of natural experiments, has used cross-country analysis. The EPL index which ﬁrst concerned only the Open Ended Contracts has been disaggregated to distinguish protection of the OECs and protection of the FTCs. Kahn [?] who uses such two indexes shows that if "reducing restrictions on ﬁring workers from permanents jobs appears to raise employment[..] these eﬀects appear small and insigniﬁcant when control is done for country speciﬁc trends". These are precisely the macroeconomic trends and shocks that make so diﬃcult a ceteris paribus assessment of national policies. We propose a modeling approach which has the fundamental advantage to be ex-ante, and can therefore analyze the eﬀects of the change in the law based with all the other major determinants of unemployment stable. We use the latest WorkSim model version we have developed in [?] , calibrated by a powerful algorithm on 63 parameters and 64 targets to analyze the ex- ante eﬀects of an essential element of the law El Khomri, namely the facilitation of the economic dismissals (article 30).


我们对El-Khomri法案的连续版本进行建模显示了一些结果上的差异，短期和长期效应可能不同。因此，声明应该由完整的劳动力市场流动模型支持，该模型集成了旧法律和新法律，以理解法律变化如何产生效应的机制。我们认为立法的细节很重要（参见[?]中同样的批评线）。为了绕过自然实验的不可用性，对改革的计量经济学分析已经使用了跨国分析。最初只涉及无固定期合同的EPL指数已经被细分，以区分OECs和FTCs的保护。Kahn[?]使用这样的两个指数表明，“减少对永久工作人员解雇的限制似乎会提高就业[..]但当对国家特定趋势进行控制时，这些效应看起来微小且无关紧要”。这正是使得对国家政策进行其他条件不变评估如此困难的宏观经济趋势和冲击。我们提出了一种建模方法，其基本优势在于是事前的，因此可以在所有其他主要失业决定因素稳定的情况下分析法律变更的效应。我们使用我们在[?]中开发的最新WorkSim模型版本进行分析，该模型通过一个强大的算法根据63个参数和64个目标进行了校准，以分析El Khomri法案的一个重要元素即经济解雇便利化（第30条）的事前效应。

The Law project contains a great number of other elements. Some have little relation with employment and unemployment. An important and hotly debated element, the so-called inversion of norms, opens the possibility to negotiate some changes at the ﬁrm level rather than at the sector level. It might aﬀect the wages and the duration of work, but the extent that the inversion will take is completely unknown, and cannot be modeled presently. These simultaneous changes, and specially those concerning the duration of work may modify some of the net eﬀects of the Law that we obtain. However the facilitation of economic dismissals can be expected to be the most important change for the labor market, and our simulations conﬁrm that the eﬀects should be considerable. Moreover an essential purpose of the paper is to propose a method to do ex ante analysis of a labor law in a detailed labor market with heterogeneous interacting agents, a method that has not been used so far. The paper presents the results corresponding to the ﬁnal version of the law, voted on July 21, 2016. The important limit of the study is that we do not have a macroeconomic model at this stage, so that we explore the direct eﬀects that a change in the institutions of the labor market may have on the employment and unemployment, leaving aside induced changes in aggregate demand and investment which in turn modify employment again. One way to look at this is to assume that they are second order eﬀects, but this may not be true.

法案包含许多其他元素。其中一些与就业和失业关系不大。一个重要且备受争议的元素是所谓的规范倒置，它开放了在公司层面而非行业层面上进行一些变革的可能性。这可能会影响工资和工作时间，但规范倒置的程度目前完全未知，无法建模。这些同时发生的变化，特别是那些关于工作时间的变化，可能会修改我们得到的法律的一些净效应。然而，经济解雇的便利化可以预期将是对劳动力市场最重要的变化，我们的模拟确认效应应该是相当大的。此外，本文的一个基本目的是提出一种方法，对具有异质性相互作用代理人的详细劳动力市场中的劳动法进行事前分析，这是迄今为止尚未使用的方法。本文呈现了2016年7月21日表决通过的法律最终版本的结果。这项研究的一个重要局限是，我们目前没有宏观经济模型，因此我们探索劳动力市场机构变化对就业和失业可能产生的直接效应，而忽略了诱发的总需求和投资变化，这反过来又会再次改变就业。一种看待这一点的方法是假设它们是二阶效应，但这可能并非事实。


Our view is rather that it is legitimate to do the intellectual experiment of isolating the direct speciﬁc role of lowering the so-called "labor market rigidities", since the international institutions repeatedly point to their responsibility in the high French unemployment rate, either at the global level, or at the level of some speciﬁc categories (young, low skilled...).5 If the direct eﬀects are not important, this emphasis may be misplaced. If they are, further development of our model into a macroeconomic model becomes a research agenda.

我们的观点是，合理地进行思维实验，孤立地考察降低所谓的“劳动力市场僵化”直接特定作用是有意义的，因为国际机构反复指出这些僵化在法国高失业率中的责任，无论是在全球层面还是在一些特定类别（如年轻人、低技能工人等）的层面上。如果这些直接效应不重要，那么这种强调可能是错位的。如果它们确实重要，那么将我们的模型发展成一个宏观经济模型将成为一个研究议程。

The Agent-Based methodology is used. It offers a method to take into account the numerous decisions and institutions mentioned, and to simulate complex systems on a computer (see [?] for a plea of their use, and [?] for an assessment of the state of the art). Agents are represented individually and they are heterogeneous. They have market but also non-market interactions
(for instance inside a household). Agents are autonomous and there is then no need for an auctioneer to close transactions, an unrealistic fiction. The decentralization of the labor market matters for its outcomes. The agents take decisions based on their information and the calculation of costs and benefits, and the profit (for the firms) or utility (for the individuals) they expect. The environment is very complex because of the institutions and the interactions, and changing. Then their rationality is bounded in the sense of [?]. Therefore, when in a given state, they choose the best of a few possible alternatives (see below for examples). The values of these alternatives cannot include computations on a infinite horizon, as is done in optimization models, but they do some intertemporal calculus. They cannot have rational expectations and do mistakes but they learn that the outcome is bad, in WorkSim, they take another decision in the new period. The institutions and legal rules that constrain the decisions are modeled precisely. Summation is done only on individual outcomes in order to compute the aggregated statistics, and this can be done for different categories of a same type of agents (young, blue-collars . . . ). These statistics can be as detailed as the scale of the model allows, and in turn this scale is determined by computation constraints. The models then allow for non-linear relations between aggregate variables, and notably crowding-out effects. The computed effects of the present law will bring a resounding example. These models can be calibrated with a varying degree of sophistication, and when the purpose is to study a policy, as in this paper, it is an essential part of the research. The development of macroeconomic Agent-Based models with labor market has a thin but long history, dating back from Barbara Bergmann and Gunnar Eliasson micro to macro models [?,?], while [?,?] built ARTEMIS, a detailed model of the French labor market, and a forerunner for the present model. Barlet et al. (2009) have also proposed a smaller but calibrated model of the French labor market to study the effect of the rise of the minimum wage and the decrease of social charges.

本研究采用基于主体的方法，该方法能够考虑到所提及的众多决策和制度，并在计算机上模拟复杂系统（参见[?]以支持其使用，以及[?]对现有技术水平进行评估）。每个主体都被个别地表示，并且它们具有异质性。它们在市场上进行交互，同时也存在非市场内部交互（例如家庭内部）。主体是自治的，因此不需要拍卖人来完成交易，这种假设是不切实际的。劳动力市场的分散化对其结果至关重要。主体根据他们的信息、成本和效益计算以及他们预期获得的利润（对于企业）或效用（对于个人）来做出决策。由于制度和相互作用的复杂性以及其变化性质，环境非常复杂。因此，在给定状态下，他们选择几种可能性中最好的一种（请参见下面示例）。这些替代方案的价值不能包括无限时间范围内的计算，如优化模型中所做的那样，但它们进行了一些跨时间计算。他们不能具有理性预期并且会犯错误，但他们会从WorkSim中学习到结果是不好的，然后在新的时期做出另一个决策。精确地对制约决策的制度和法律规则进行建模。在计算聚合统计数据时，仅对个体结果进行求和，并且可以针对同一类型的不同类别主体（如年轻人、蓝领等）进行此操作。这些统计数据可以根据模型允许的规模详细到任何程度，而该规模又由计算限制确定。因此，这些模型允许聚合变量之间存在非线性关系，尤其是排挤效应。本研究将通过计算当前法律的效果来提供一个引人注目的例子。这些模型可以根据不同程度的复杂性进行校准，在研究政策时（如本文所述）是研究中必不可少的一部分。宏观经济学中基于主体的劳动力市场模型有着薄弱但悠久的历史，追溯到Barbara Bergmann和Gunnar Eliasson微观到宏观模型[?,?]，而[?,?]构建了ARTEMIS，一个详细描述法国劳动力市场并为现有模型铺平道路的模型。Barlet等人（2009）还提出了一个较小但经过校准的法国劳动力市场模型，以研究最低工资上涨和社会保险费下降的影响。

## 2 Overview Of The Model Worksim



In this paper, we extend WorkSim, a detailed model of the French labor market, which reproduces the gross flows of individuals between the main states, employment, unemployment and inactivity Employment is subdivided into the fixed term contracts (FTC) and open-ended contracts (OEC). Due to lack of space, the presentation will not include the equations which can be found in [?]. The flows are generated by the interactions of the rational decisions of numerous heterogeneous agents (around 20 000 in our simulations), representing multi-job firms and individuals, who belong to households. The individuals take into account the incomes of the other members of their household when they decide. They also age and the demographic events of the households are reproduced, based on current statistics, but aiming for a steady state. Individuals retire and die, and are replaced by young individuals who become agents when they are 15 years old. The flows generate a consistent system of flows accounts, so that all the costs and benefits induced by each flow unit are accounted for, a necessary tool for precise market and policy analysis. The core theoretical framework for the decisions is costly search of jobs by the individuals and of workers by the firms, the so called "search theory" and the most used and flexible intellectual framework in economics for studying labor markets as flows of creation and destruction of jobs and as mobility flow systems as well (see [?]). The individuals base their decisions on comparisons of utility between the different states they can reach or try to reach. For instance an employed individual may choose between searching for a new job, either searching on-the-job or quitting to be a full time unemployed searcher, quitting for inactivity, or just staying a non-searching employee in the same firm. The firms compute the expected profits from decisions about opening vacant jobs or not, firing or not, etc. It should be stressed that the methodology of modeling individual heterogeneous decisions in the search process gives much more precise microeconomic foundations to matching in a decentralized labor market than the aggregate matching function widely used nowadays, which assumes homogeneity of the agents. Our decision methodology also implies modeling anticipations, a crucial element in the model which will be exposed below. Finally we obtain a complete stock-flow system which is summarized in the Figure 1. LA LISTE DES VARIABLES EN CLAIR DOIT ETRE MISE EN LEGENDE
The institutions constrain the decisions: among the important institutions are the minimum wage, the welfare system, and the main features of Labor Law. For instance, for the purpose of the study of a change in firing rules, crucial institutions are the computation of the firing costs, the measure of the constraint behind the rule "serious economic problems" to trigger economic dismissals without undergoing the risk of litigation, and the grace period before opening again a terminated FTC. It is possible to modify an institution and study the effects on the variables of interest at the aggregate level of the market or at the level of the different categories of workers. The model is then a powerful exploratory tool for labor market policy. The demand for the (representative) good is exogenous and stable since we look for a steady state as a benchmark to study the impact of the change in the law. However the market share of each firm follows a random walk (combined with a random trend changing each year), which can be interpreted as representing the stochastic changes of tastes of consumers for the variety of the good that a given firm produces. The decision of a firm on the opening of a new job, when present demand exceeds production capacity, is based on a computation of the expected discounted future profit on such a job, taking into account the expected revenue from the sales, and costs, namely the (learned) cost per period of the vacancy over the expected vacancy duration, the expected costs of labor (wages, social security..), the amortization of training costs if any, and the termination costs.

本文扩展了法国劳动力市场的详细模型WorkSim，该模型重现了个体在就业、失业和非活动之间的总流动。就业被细分为固定期限合同（FTC）和无固定期限合同（OEC）。由于篇幅限制，本文不包括方程式，请参阅[?]获取详细信息。这些流动是由众多异质主体（约20,000个）的理性决策相互作用产生的，这些主体代表着多职位企业和个人，并属于家庭。个体在做出决策时考虑到家庭其他成员的收入情况。他们还会随着时间推移而变老，并根据当前统计数据再现家庭的人口事件，但目标是达到稳态。个体退休和去世后，年轻人取而代之成为主体者，他们在15岁时开始参与模拟。这些流动生成了一套一致的流量账户系统，以便准确计算每个流动单位引起的所有成本和效益，这对于进行精确的市场和政策分析是必不可少的工具。决策核心理论框架是个体进行昂贵搜索工作以及企业进行昂贵搜索工人的成本，即所谓的“搜索理论”，这是经济学中研究劳动力市场的创造和销毁工作岗位以及流动性流动系统最常用和灵活的智力框架（参见[?]）。个体基于不同状态之间的效用比较来做出决策，例如就业人员可以选择在职搜索新工作，或者辞职成为全职失业人员进行搜索，或者退出活动状态，或者只是继续在同一公司中保持非搜索雇员。企业计算有关开设空缺职位、解雇与否等决策的预期利润。值得强调的是，在模拟个体异质决策过程方面，我们提供了比目前广泛使用的总体匹配函数更精确的微观经济基础，并假设主体者具有同质性。我们的决策方法还意味着对预期进行建模，这是该模型中一个关键要素，在下文将详细介绍。最后，我们得到了一个完整的库存-流量系统，如图1所示。

制度对决策施加了限制：其中重要机构包括最低工资、福利制度和劳动法律主要特点。例如，在研究解雇规则变化的目的下，关键机构包括解雇成本的计算、触发经济解雇而不承担诉讼风险的“严重经济问题”规定背后的约束度量，以及终止FTC后再次开放的宽限期。可以修改机构并研究对市场总体水平或不同类别工人水平上感兴趣变量的影响。因此，该模型是劳动力市场政策的强大探索工具。需求（代表性商品）是外生且稳定的，因为我们寻求稳态作为研究法律变化影响的基准。然而，每家公司的市场份额遵循随机游走（结合每年改变一次的随机趋势），这可以被解释为代表性公司所生产商品种类消费者口味随机变化。当现有需求超过生产能力时，公司对于开设新职位时会根据预期折现未来利润进行计算，并考虑销售收入和成本，即空缺职位每个周期学习到成本、预期空缺持续时间、劳动力成本（工资、社会保障等）、培训成本摊销以及解雇成本。

These are general benefits and costs for any type of job. However the model goes beyond to endogenize the choice between an OEC and a FTC, and in the latter case, endogenizes the specified duration of the FTC. We have undertaken a thorough treatment of this choice, and it the basis to the main contribution that we can bring to the analysis of the El Khomri law project. The firms form anticipations on own future demand. More precisely each firm studies three scenarios of its demand evolution within a range that is given by the history of its demand (trend and variance): upper and lower values for a standard error, and the trend scenario. We compute the complete costs and revenue at the horizon of the contract, for each type of contract, taking into account for an OEC the option of economic dismissal under some conditions and costs, and for a FTC contract, considering a set of of discrete durations, including one possible renewal (of same duration). Then, the firm weights each scenario, with weights calibrated simultaneously with the other unknown parameters of the model. This results into possible asymmetries for the bad, the neutral and the good scenario, which can receive an interpretation in prospect theory [?]. The firm then chooses the contract which gives the highest expected profit. If this expected profit is negative the job is not created. (see figure ??below)
This framework sets the stage to a multidimensional arbitrage between opening a FTC and an OEC when present demand is higher than capacity. For the first time in the (tiny) literature on the endogenization of the choice between these contract types, we consider that it is not a question of substitution based on one motive only, but that there are two types of substitutions, and also two types of complementarities, so that the methodology we use (agent based model plus calibration) appears as a powerful tool to evaluate the mix of the two contracts, and the effects that policy can have on that mix. The first substitution factor is the termination cost, the factor which has focused most of the analysis in the literature although we include here essential but neglected elements. The OECs have a cost of termination which is the severance pay. We add an estimate of the hoarding costs which start from the day demand declines until the day the employer fires, considering that he has run into a "serious economic problem", that the current law requires. However the employee may sue and the definition of what a serious economic problem is fuzzy and in a each case in the hands of the industrial judges. The employer then includes expected litigation costs. For FTCs, we consider costs specific to them, such as the grace period which delays a new hire when the contract is terminated. The second important substitution factor is the amortization of the costs of training newly hired workers , which can be far too costly to hire on a short FTC6. We have highlighted also two complementarity factors. The first one is the screening that FTCs allow before hiring on an OEC, which di-
6 another interpretation of this type of cost is the lower than standard productivity when learning the job minishes the number of dismissals (personal as well as economic). The second is the buffer that FTCs constitute when the firm faces the uncertain future demand we mentioned. If the employer has a sufficient number of FTCs, he can still decide to hire an OEC since he calculates that the FTCs will come to an end and he does not have to fire the OEC if demand falls. The cost of dismissal is avoided and the benefit from a better amortization of the training costs is gained. The computation of all the terms of the arbitrage determines the net benefits of each type of contract and the duration if the FTCs of all durations are more profitable than an OEC. The distribution of durations of FTCs is then endogenous, its variance is high, and the (very) short durations the majority (the median duration of a FTC is 3.5 weeks). These are prominent stylized facts in the French labor market, and a social issue.

这些是任何类型工作的一般利益和成本。然而，该模型超越了这一点，将选择OEC和FTC之间的选择内生化，并在后者的情况下内生化了指定的FTC持续时间。我们对这个选择进行了彻底处理，并且它是我们对El Khomri法案分析所能做出的主要贡献的基础。公司对自身未来需求进行预测。更具体地说，每家公司研究其需求演变的三种情景，在由其需求历史（趋势和方差）给出范围内：标准误差上限和下限值以及趋势情景。我们计算每种合同在合同期限处的完整成本和收入，考虑到OEC在某些条件和成本下经济解雇选项，以及FTC合同考虑一组离散持续时间，包括可能再次续签（相同持续时间）。然后，公司根据与模型中其他未知参数同时校准的权重为每个情景加权。这导致了坏、中性和好情景可能存在不对称性，在展望理论中可以解释[?]。然后公司选择带来最高预期利润的合同。如果预期利润为负，则不会创建该工作（见下图）。
这个框架为当现有需求高于产能时开设FTC和OEC之间的多维套利创造了条件。在关于内生化这两种合同类型选择的（微小）文献中，我们首次考虑到这不仅仅是基于一个动机的替代问题，而是存在两种类型的替代以及两种类型的互补性，因此我们使用的方法（基于主体的模型加上校准）被视为评估这两种合同组合以及政策对该组合可能产生影响的强大工具。第一个替代因素是解雇成本，这个因素在文献中得到了大部分分析的关注，尽管我们在此包括了一些重要但被忽视的元素。OECs有一个解雇成本，即遣散费用。我们还添加了从需求下降之日起到雇主解雇之日止所需支付的滞留成本估计，考虑到他遭遇“严重经济问题”，而当前法律要求如此。然而，员工可能会提起诉讼，并且对“严重经济问题”的定义模糊不清，在每个案例中由工业法官决定。然后雇主包括预期诉讼成本。对于FTC，我们考虑了与之相关的特定成本，例如在合同终止时延迟新员工的宽限期。第二个重要的替代因素是对新雇员培训成本的摊销，这可能是雇佣短期FTC过于昂贵。我们还强调了两个互补因素。第一个是FTC允许在OEC上雇佣之前进行筛选，从而减少解雇（个人和经济）的数量。第二个是当公司面临我们提到的不确定未来需求时，FTC构成了缓冲区。如果雇主拥有足够数量的FTC，他仍然可以决定雇佣OEC，因为他计算出FTC将结束，并且如果需求下降，则不必解雇OEC。避免解雇成本并获得更好地摊销培训成本带来的利益。套利所有条款的计算确定了每种合同类型和持续时间是否比OEC更有利可图的净收益。然后，FTCs持续时间分布是内生性的，其方差很高，并且（非常）短暂持续时间占多数（FTC中位数持续时间为3.5周）。这些都是法国劳动力市场上突出的刻板事实，也是一个社会问题。

Some firms may go bankrupt and are replaced with an entrepreneur who starts alone. The model is at a scale of 1 to 2300 and has the week as the base period, in order to reproduce the gross flows, rather than transition rates between distant dates, which would miss most of the very short spells in FTCs (as is the case for studies based on the Labor Force Survey), and most mobilities7.

有些公司可能会破产，然后由一个独立创业的企业家取而代之。该模型采用1至2300的比例尺，并以周为基准周期，以重现总体流动情况，而不是远离日期之间的转移率。这样做可以避免忽略大部分FTC中非常短暂的工作期（与基于劳动力调查的研究相比），以及大多数流动性情况。

The model is calibrated by the CMA-ES algorithm CMA-ES (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy) designed by [?]. The principle of this evolutionary algorithm is to test step-by-step new generations of points in the parameters space. Each new generation of points is drawn stochastically according to the results obtained with the previous generation of points. The mean and the covariance matrix of the distribution of the new randomly drawn points are updated incrementally in order to move towards the best results obtained by previous generations. The fitness function is minimized at the horizon of 416 periods in a steady state. Presently the steady state reproduces 63 observed variables for the year 2014 as weighted targets in the fitness function and we obtain a median standard error of 8.5%. There are 60 parameters calibrated and the others are taken from the law or demographic statistics.

该模型使用了由[?]设计的CMA-ES算法（协方差矩阵适应进化策略）进行校准。这种进化算法的原理是逐步在参数空间中测试新一代点。每个新一代点都是根据前一代点的结果进行随机绘制的。通过逐步更新新绘制点的分布的均值和协方差矩阵，以朝着前几代获得的最佳结果移动。在稳态下，我们将健康函数最小化至416个周期。目前，稳态下通过将2014年观测到的63个变量作为加权目标放入健康函数中进行重现，并且我们获得了8.5%的中位数标准误差。其中有60个参数进行了校准，其他参数则来自法律或人口统计数据。

The model generates some important specific characteristics of the French Labor Market in 2014. We give here the simulated figures. The results display the very important share of FTCs in terms of flows, 80% of the total (FTC plus OEC), and the contrasting fairly low figure of the share of the workers employed in such contracts: 8% 8. The unemployment of the young is also much higher than the unemployment of the older workers, at 25% against 9.3% for the 25-49 and 6.35% for the 50-659. This dualism in the French Labor Market, is confirmed by the differences in the patterns of gross flows of the categories of workers (see Goudet et al ...). The model computes all the simulated flows, but allows for comparison with those which can be measured by the published statistics, and the results fit roughly. Most workers are stable in their OECs, while a minority undergoes short spells of employment in FTCs and spells of unemployment between them. Moreover this dualism persists for part of the young workers when they age while the others obtain more stable OEC. Another important result is the values of the calibrated weights in the anticipations. The weight give by the employers to the pessimistic scenario (a standard error below the trend) is 90%, meaning that French employers have a very high loss aversion. Other novel results are obtained but will not be detailed here, since they are not the core of this paper.

该模型呈现了2014年法国劳动力市场的一些重要特征。以下是模拟结果。结果显示，FTC（固定期限合同）在流动性方面占据了非常重要的份额，占总体的80%（FTC加上OEC），而从雇佣此类合同的工人所占比例来看，则相对较低，仅为8%。年轻人的失业率也远高于老年工人，前者为25%，而25-49岁组为9.3%，50-65岁组为6.35%。这种法国劳动力市场的二元性在工人类别的总体流动模式中得到了证实（参见Goudet等人...）。该模型计算了所有模拟流动情况，并与公布统计数据进行了大致比较。大多数工人在他们的OEC（长期雇佣合同）中保持稳定，而少数工人则在FTC之间经历短暂就业和失业期间。此外，在部分年轻工人变老时，这种二元性仍然存在，而其他一些工人则获得更稳定的OEC。另一个重要结果是预期中校准权重值。雇主对悲观情景（低于趋势的标准误差）给予了90%的权重，这意味着法国雇主非常害怕损失。还获得了其他新颖的结果，但本文的核心不在此处详述。

## 3 Dismissals Facilitation In The El-Khomri Law



First we simulate the facilitation of the economic dismissals, for a steady state of the exogenous aggregate demand, and secondly we study the differential effect on unemployment before the El-Khomri law and after the law when aggregate demand changes exogenously. Before the new law, the economic dismissals are allowed if the firm faces "serious economic problems". In our understanding of case law which has taken generally a strict interpretation, we interpret these problems as able to lead to the failure of the firm, and since we have to put a figure, as losses over a period of one year, which corresponds to the computation of the accounts of small firms. Judges may have their own interpretation over the minimum level of losses which could lead to failure. The minimum level is then not our arbitrary decision but calibrated simultaneously with the other parameters of the model, and found as 28% of sales revenue in the reference simulation. The judge intervenes only if the fired workers sue, which happens in 1% of cases of economic dismissals. However the workers win in 64% of the litigations. The version adopted by the Council of Ministers on March 24, 2016 (Art. L. 1233-3-2) offered two different sets of conditions according to the presence of an agreement on the dismissals obtained by collective bargaining at the firm level, or the absence of such an agreement. We name the first ECO1 and the second ECO2. In the first case, dismissals are possible if a firm has a decline in demand during two successive quarters or losses during a quarter, in the second case, the requirement is a decline in demand during four successive quarters or a loss during a semester. The final version of the El-Khomri law voted on July 21 (article 30) conditions firing to a decline either in its demand or its turnover computed over a certain period, which rises in the firm size. For firms under 11 employees, the period is 1 quarter, for those between 11 and less than 50 the period is 2 quarters, for firms between 50 and less than 300, the delay is 3 quarters, and for firms with 300 employees or more the delay is 4 quarters.The government motives for such a differentiation are likely to be that large firms have a stronger financial position and are able to resist profit declines or losses, and also that a mild decline can be enough to fire some workers so that a high delay should prevent dismissals for short run motivations. On the other hand, around 45% of firms have between 1 and 10 employees (45% have no employee), and they are less likely to fire even one worker in case of such a mild decline, but they have a weaker financial position that would threatens their survival if the delay for firing was long, as it was the case before the law. We name this set of conditions ECO4. Two remarks are in order. First the writing of the article 30 is ambiguous and allows for an interpretation in which the demand in each quarter should be compared to the corresponding quarter in the preceding year, a more demanding condition. We have simulated this version (called ECO 3), which yields less flexibility, but will not report it here to avoid an inflation of figures, and since it is less likely to be the favored interpretation. Second other alternative motives for firing such as technological mutation are written in the two successive law projects. The conditions are not precise, and moreover, they already existed before the El-Khomri law. Their persistence means that they should have no differential impact, and we can leave them aside.

首先，我们对经济解雇的便利化进行了模拟，针对外生总需求的稳态情况。其次，我们研究了在外生总需求发生变化时，El-Khomri法案之前和之后对失业率的差异影响。在新法案出台之前，只有当企业面临“严重经济问题”时才允许进行经济解雇。根据我们对司法实践的理解（通常采取严格解释），我们将这些问题理解为可能导致企业失败的问题，并且由于需要给出一个具体数字，在小型企业账目计算中表示为一年期间的损失。法官可能对可能导致失败的最低损失水平有自己的解释。最低水平不是我们任意决定的，而是与模型中其他参数同时校准得出，并在参考模拟中确定为销售收入的28%。只有在被解雇工人提起诉讼时，法官才会介入，这种情况发生在1% 的经济解雇案件中。然而，在64% 的诉讼中工人获胜。

2016年3月24日内阁通过版本（第L. 1233-3-2条）提供了两组不同条件：一组是公司层面集体谈判达成解雇协议的情况下，另一组是没有这样的协议的情况下。我们将第一种情况称为ECO1，第二种情况称为ECO2。在第一种情况下，如果一个公司连续两个季度需求下降或者一个季度亏损，就可以进行解雇；在第二种情况下，要求是连续四个季度需求下降或者一个学期亏损。7月21日通过的El-Khomri法案最终版本（第30条）规定了解雇必须满足其需求或营业额在一定时期内（与公司规模有关）出现下降。对于员工少于11人的企业，时期为1个季度；对于员工在11到50人之间的企业，时期为2个季度；对于员工在50到300人之间的企业，时期为3个季度；对于员工超过300人的企业，则需要4个季度。

政府区分这些条件可能是因为大型企业具有更强大的财务实力，并能够抵御利润下滑或亏损，并且即使出现轻微衰退也足以解雇部分工人，因此较长时间延迟应该防止短期动机的解雇。另一方面，约45% 的企业员工在1到10人之间（45% 的企业没有员工），在出现轻微衰退时更不太可能解雇一个工人，但他们的财务状况较弱，如果解雇期限过长将威胁到他们的生存，而这在法案出台之前就是事实。我们将这组条件称为ECO4。

需要注意的是，第30条的写法存在歧义，并且允许一种解释，即每个季度的需求应与前一年相应季度进行比较，这是一种更严格的条件。我们已经模拟了这个版本（称为ECO 3），它具有较少的灵活性，但为避免数据膨胀，在此不予报告，并且由于不太可能成为首选解释。

其次，在两个连续法案中还提到了其他导致解雇的替代动机（如技术变革）。条件并不明确，并且此类动机在El-Khomri法案之前就已存在。它们持续存在意味着它们不应该产生差异影响，因此我们可以忽略它们。

## 3.1 Effects Under A Stable Aggregate Demand



We will focus our analysis on the law as it has been finally voted. ECO4 yields effects which change over time after the introduction of the law. They evolve during the first 3 years to stabilize generally after 4 years. The first can be termed short run effects and the latter long run effects. This comes from the fact that it takes time for the firing conditions to be filled under the new law, even if they are weaker than previously. Hiring requires only that the firm faces a rise in demand and that the job is expected to be profitable. The short term effects should then be favorable, but under stable aggregate demand, individual declines are just as many as the increases in the long run and the conditions to fire get satisfied. This does not mean that long run results should be null, but they should be less favorable than short term effects. Permanent jobs are more profitable because of the decrease of firing costs (including hoarding costs), and, when deciding over firing or not, firms take into account not only the legal condition, but also the comparative cost benefits of firing versus keeping the employee. Lower firing costs means that it is less costly to keep an employee during a downturn than firing and rehiring another who has to be trained. We will first consider figures for all the population.

我们将重点分析最终通过的法律。ECO4在法律实施后产生的效果随时间变化。在前3年内，这些效果逐渐演变并在4年后趋于稳定。我们将称之为短期效应和长期效应。这是因为根据新法律，填补解雇条件需要时间，即使它们比以前更宽松。只要公司面临需求增加并且预计工作具有盈利性，就可以进行招聘。因此，短期效应应该是积极的，但在总需求稳定的情况下，长期来看个体减少与增加数量相当，并且满足解雇条件。这并不意味着长期结果应该为零，但它们可能不如短期效应积极。由于解雇成本（包括囤积成本）的降低，永久性工作更具盈利性，并且在决定是否解雇时，企业不仅考虑法律条件，还考虑解雇与保留员工之间的成本收益比较。较低的解雇成本意味着在经济下行时保留员工比解雇并重新招聘受过培训的员工更具成本优势。我们首先考虑整个人口的数据。

After 1 year the difference in global unemployment with the reference simulation is non significant, and is remains so after 4 years (the decline is 23,030). Employment does not rise after one year, and rises only by 90,750 after 4
years (significant only at 10%) 10.The increase in employment is higher than the decrease in unemployment since the latter stimulates entry of non participants into the labor market, a well documented labor market behavior that the model is able to reproduce [?]. However ECO 4 is very favorable to the young
(15-24), both in the short and the long run, with a decline in unemployment of 222,000 after 1 year and of 148,610 after 4 years. This means a huge decrease of the unemployment rate by 7.5 points in the first year and remains 5.6 points under the simulation reference after 4 years (starting from a simulated 24.6% - the observed value is 23.4%). The increase in employment is 247,000 after 4
years. If we turn to the central age class (25-49), unemployment and employment do not show any significant change. Finally the seniors (50-65) undergo a substantial rise in unemployment compared to the situation before the law, 145,000 after 1 year, and 101,430 after 4 years, from 6.35% to 9.2%, i.e. more than 2 points, and an decrease in employment (-121,160). In their case, the longer run, specially after 8 years improves their situation which becomes only very slightly worse than before the law in terms of unemployment, but the loss in employment remains substantial. There is clearly a discouragement effect.

经过1年的时间，与参考模拟相比，全球失业率的差异并不显著，并且在4年后仍然如此（下降了23,030人）。就业在一年后没有增长，在4年后只增加了90,750人（仅在10%的显著水平下显著）。就业增加高于失业减少，因为后者刺激了非参与者进入劳动力市场，这是一个被广泛研究的劳动力市场行为，该模型能够复制。然而，在短期和长期内，ECO 4对年轻人（15-24岁）非常有利，失业率在1年后下降了22.2万人，在4年后下降了14.9万人。这意味着第一年失业率大幅下降7.5个百分点，并且在参考模拟之后的4年内保持5.6个百分点（从模拟的24.6%开始-观察值为23.4%）。就业增加了24.7万人，在4年内。如果我们转向中间年龄段（25-49岁），失业和就业没有显示出任何显着变化。最后，老年人（50-65岁）与法律实施前相比面临着明显上升的失业情况，在1年后增加了14.5万人，在4年后增加了10.1万人，从6.35%上升到9.2%，即超过2个百分点，并且就业减少了（-12.1万人）。在他们的情况下，长期来看，特别是在8年后，他们的情况有所改善，失业情况只比法律实施前稍微差一点，但就业损失仍然相当大。显然存在一种使人灰心的效应。

This is only part of the story. The mobility on the labor market is found to change very deeply, and the nature of the labor market is transformed. The share of FTCs in the hires falls from 80% to 30% after 4 years. The share of OECs in hires is the complement and then rises from 20% to 80%. The OECs becomes the dominant hiring contract. The proportion of FTCs in ongoing contracts falls from 8.0% to 2.33%, while the remaining contracts are shorter than before the law (renewal not included) with a mean of 1.9 weeks against 3.6 weeks, meaning that the FTCs are now used only when future demand forecasts are bad and no training is required11. The economic dismissal rate jumps from 0.5% to 19% after 4 years, a major change in a French labor market characterised by a very low economic dismissal rate, since it has steadily decreased over the years, probably because the conventional separations are an easier way to make an employee leave. These "contractual terminations" (*ruptures conventionnelles* in French) of OECs, a bargained separation between the employer and an employee, are not modeled as such here but included in the personal dismissals. A caveat should then be included. These contractual terminations can be expected to rise as a consequence of the law in order to avoid litigation and should smooth somewhat the explosion of economic dismissals. Yet this would not change the fact that, after 4 years, the mean duration of OECs is 3 years, half the duration before the law, as a consequence of the rise of economic dismissals. Two major conclusions can be drawn. First a significant substitution of the young to the seniors takes place, although it declines with time. Second the new load of adjustment set on the OECs has the logical effect of making the FTCs an almost useless tool of flexibility for the employers except when they have a demand anticipation which is so bad that they favor jobs with very short durations. The explanation of the opposed effects concerning the young versus the other categories is clear. The young were much more often than the others in FTCs (22% against 7.5% for the 25-50 and 4.7% for the seniors) and benefit from their fall. The effect then goes much beyond the higher flexibility of OECs. The El-Komri law raises the integration of the young into OECs. This shows that the two complementarity factors between OECs and FTCs, screening (plus experience gains) and buffer, are much smaller than the substitution effects in the case of the El-Khomri law. We certainly overestimate the substitution, since we assume that all the jobs (except the "contrats d'usage") can be held with any of the two contracts. There are jobs that require a high duration to build trust and can be held only under an OEC. Inversely only FTC contracts can be signed to replace absent workers12. This puts some ceiling on the substitution. This ceiling is not known and have avoided arbitrary limits. However we maintain that this mechanism, the net substitution of OECs to FTCs, and its effect, the substitution of young workers to seniors, will be very significant. It has been overlooked or greatly underestimated by non quantitative analysis of the law. The second major conclusion is that the flexibility which existed through FTCs takes another form. The proportion of workers who have been unemployed at least once in the year rises by 2 points, with a percentage which goes up to 20%. But if one looks at the OECs, the change is stronger. They become much shorter on average, hence more precarious. The probability for an employee in an OEC to loose a job rises from 8.17% to 13.13, almost 5 points. A last adverse consequence of the shorter duration of jobs is that the 3 types of human capital (general, specific to an occupation, specific to a job) decrease substantially on average.

这只是故事的一部分。劳动力市场的流动性发生了深刻的变化，劳动力市场的性质也发生了转变。在经过4年后，全日制合同（FTCs）在雇佣中所占比例从80%下降到30%。而其他形式的雇佣合同（OECs）所占比例则相应增加，从20%上升到80%。OECs成为主导性的雇佣合同。持续合同中FTCs所占比例从8.0%下降到2.33%，而其他合同的期限较法律实施前更短（不包括续签），平均为1.9周，而之前为3.6周，这意味着现在只有当未来需求预测不好且不需要培训时才会使用FTCs11。经济解雇率在4年后从0.5%跃升至19%，这是法国劳动力市场中经济解雇率发生重大变化，因为多年来它一直稳步下降，可能是因为常规离职是让员工离开的更容易方式。“契约解除”（法语中称为“ruptures conventionnelles”）属于OECs，在此模型中未单独建模，但包含在个人解雇中。需要注意的是，这些契约解除预计会因法律而增加，以避免诉讼，并在一定程度上平缓经济解雇的激增。然而，这并不改变一个事实，在4年后，OECs的平均持续时间为3年，是法律实施前的一半，这是由于经济解雇的增加所导致的。可以得出两个重要结论。首先，在年轻人和老年人之间发生了显著替代，尽管随着时间推移逐渐减少。其次，对OECs施加的新调整负担使得FTCs对雇主来说几乎成为无用的灵活工具，除非他们对未来需求预测非常糟糕且不需要培训11。关于年轻人与其他类别之间相反效应的解释是清晰的。与其他人相比，年轻人更常被雇佣为FTCs（22%对25-50岁群体7.5%，对老年人4.7%），并从中受益。因此，在弹性工作合同方面超越了OECs更高灵活性11. El-Komri法案提高了将年轻人纳入OECs中的整合程度11. 这表明，在El-Khomri法案的情况下，OECs和FTCs之间的两个互补因素，筛选（加上经验增益）和缓冲作用，在年轻人与其他类别之间的替代效应中要小得多。我们当然高估了替代效应，因为我们假设所有工作（除了“contrats d'usage”）都可以使用任何一种合同来进行。有些工作需要较长时间来建立信任，并且只能在OEC下进行。相反，只有FTC合同可以签署以替代缺席的员工12. 这对替代效应施加了一定限制。这个限制是未知的，并且避免了任意限制。然而，我们坚持认为这种机制——OECs对FTCs的净替代以及其影响——年轻工人对老年人的替代将非常显著。这一点在非定量分析中被忽视或被大大低估了该法律产生的第二个重要结论是存在通过FTCs存在灵活性采取另一种形式。在过去一年中至少有一次失业的劳动者所占比例上升2个百分点，达到20%。但如果看OECs，则变化更大。它们平均变得更短，因此更加不稳定。在OEC中失去工作的概率从8.17%上升到13.13%，几乎增加了5个百分点。工作期限缩短的最后一个不利后果是，三种人力资本（一般人力资本、职业特定人力资本和岗位特定人力资本）平均大幅减少。

## 3.2 Sensitivity Of Adjustment To Aggregate Demand



We now change exogenously aggregate demand in order to compare the effects on the unemployment rate of the firing conditions before the law and after the law. Figure 3 gives values after 4 years. The adjustment of the employment is predicted to be more sensitive to aggregate demand after the law. When demand rises by 10%, unemployment decreases by 2.97 points, instead of 1.95 points in the simulation without the law. If demand declines under its value in the reference simulation by 10%, then unemployment increases by 4.64 points instead 3.09 points. First when demand rises above the reference value, the employers hire more easily on OECs, and unemployment decreases more under the law. Second, if demand decreases under its value in the reference simulation, economic dismissals are more important, the suppression of the hoarded labor is more complete, and unemployment rises more under the law El-Khomri. The responses become very asymmmetric for large (and unrealistic) changes. If demand becomes very high, there always remains some search unemployment by workers who take the time to find a job which satisfies their reservation utility. However if demand becomes very low, the ajustment of the labor force by the employers is more complete under the El-Khomri law and the unemployment becomes much higher than in the reference simulation. This experiment on changing exogenous demand highlights the increased macroeconomic flexibility which was a purpose of the law, concerning economic dismissal conditions. It shows that if demand increases exogenously, the unemployment declines more than without the law, but the model does not show that it declines just because the law is implemented, for a given aggregate demand.

为了比较法律实施前后对失业率的影响，我们现在改变外生的总需求。图3显示了4年后的数值。预计在法律实施后，就业调整对总需求更为敏感。当需求上升10%时，失业率下降2.97个百分点，而没有该法律的模拟中只下降1.95个百分点。如果需求低于参考模拟中的值10%，那么失业率将增加4.64个百分点，而不是3.09个百分点。首先，在需求超过参考值时，雇主更容易在OEC上雇佣员工，并且在法律下失业率下降得更多。其次，在需求低于参考模拟中的值时，经济解雇更为重要，扼制囤积劳动力更加完全，在El-Khomri法律下失业率上升得更多。对于大幅度（并且不切实际）的变化来说，这种反应变得非常不对称。如果需求非常高，则仍然存在一些搜索失业情况，即工人花时间找到满足其保留效用的工作机会。然而，如果需求非常低，则根据El-Khomri法律进行劳动力调整更加完全，失业率比参考模拟中要高得多。这个改变外生需求的实验突显了该法律对经济解雇条件增加的宏观经济灵活性。它表明，如果需求外生增加，失业率下降的幅度比没有该法律时更大，但模型并未显示仅仅因为实施了该法律，对于给定的总需求而言失业率就会下降。

## 4 Conclusions



The experiments with WorkSim bring food for thought since they are not what the proponents expected, when writing the law. First hopes to raise total employment by facilitating the economic dismissals are not confirmed, since hires and fires rise simultaneously and empirically, happen to cancel. Our results are the first available for the French case (at least for the El- Khomri law), but they are not contradictory with the available literature on EPL reforms, theoretical and empirical. The theoretical literature based on optimal firms decisions in response to firing costs reforms dates back to [?]. It takes into account that employers forecast, when hiring on OECs, that firing will be costly: lower firing costs increase fires and hires but the impact on the average level of employment and unemployment is theoretically ambiguous. However it did not take into account the two-tier structure of the labor market.

通过对WorkSim的实验，我们得出了一些令人深思的结论，这些结论与该法律的支持者最初的期望不同。首先，希望通过简化经济解雇程序来提高总就业率的愿望并未得到证实，因为雇佣和解雇同时上升，并在实证上相互抵消。我们的研究结果是法国案例中（至少是针对El-Khomri法律）首次公开发表的，但它们与有关劳动力规定改革的现有文献在理论和实证方面并不矛盾。基于对解雇成本改革下企业最优决策的理论文献可以追溯到[?]年。它考虑到雇主在招聘时预计解雇将会带来成本：降低解雇成本会增加解雇和招聘，但对就业水平和失业率平均水平的影响在理论上是模棱两可的。然而，它没有考虑劳动力市场两层结构。

The literature has then evolved to include the existence of FTCs. Then the protection can change for one of the two types of contracts, or the two. What matters most is the gap in the protection rights. In our case the protection for OECs is lower and the protection for FTCs does not change, so that the demand of FTCs can be expected to be different. No study on the French case has been done for former reforms, for lack of a non treated group, but some cross country studies can be found including France. We already mentioned that [?] finds no effect on employment if national trends are taken into account. [?] do not study reforms but show on a cross-country data set that the more rigid the protection of OEcs is, the more the firms use temporary workers to face workload fluctuations, a conclusion that the change in the French law illustrates. [?] for Portugal finds that a increase of the EPL for OECs yields an increase in the labor share of the FTCs. Second, several effects that have not been studied precisely in the literature before appear with force in our study: two opposed effects on precariousness appear, that show the complexity of a labor market policy: the FTCs fall abruptly, a decrease in precariousness, and the mean duration of an OEC is greatly shortened, a rise in precariousness. Both effects are intuitive but our study of the change in the law suggests massive effects, even though our results overestimate the technical possibilities of substitution between the contracts. A better integration of the young in OECs is achieved, although the effect decreases in the long run. Moreover the young crowd out the seniors since as shown, the total effect is neutral. Finally the changes in exogenous demand show that the EL-Khomri law appears as a favorable condition to decrease unemployment if demand rises, not a sufficient condition. Moreover the adjustment is higher also in case of demand decrease. However more work, which on our agenda, is needed to make our model more reliable. First, even if modeling only the article 30, some effects of the reform on aggregate demand may alter the results. On average firms see their profits rise by 16% as a result of the faster suppression of hoarded labor and of lower wages. The mean wage decreases by 9% since the lenghts of spells in OECs decrease (and productivity is lower). Lower wages have a negative effect on demand. Higher profits have effects which depend on their utilisation. They may mean more investments and/or a decrease in prices that improves competitiveness and foreign and internal demand. Then opposed effects on demand occur, but the net effect has no reason to be null. We intend to build a simple agentbased model of the goods and credit markets to embed WorkSim. Second we are building an extension of the model with temporary help jobs, which will allow a more precise assessment of the substitutions between the 3 contracts. Third we intend to study the lifetime effects of the El-Khomri law on cohorts of workers entering the labor market under the law versus cohorts entering and do their carrier without the law, the artificial counterpart to natural experiments. Other elements of the law may alter its effects. The employers may be tempted to increase the duration of work since the supplementary hours are less costly, and this lowers the employment in the firm which puts this increase into practice. However macroeconomic effects of the duration of work through the salaries, the profits, and the change in competitiveness are complex, and require the macroeoconomic framework we mentioned above. We have also left aside for future work another element in the law, the "guarantee for the young", aimed at providing them a welfare subsidy and a strengthened help for finding a job. More precisions would be needed to model such an ALP , since crowding out effects, that our model can easily study, are possible. Therefore we will avoid the flat judgment that many economists have on this complex law, beyond the important consequences that our experiments have uncovered.

随后，相关文献逐渐开始涵盖固定期限合同（FTCs）的存在。在这种情况下，保护权利可以对两种或一种合同进行调整，最重要的是保护权利之间的差距。在我们的案例中，OECs的保护较低，而FTCs的保护没有改变，因此可以预期FTCs的需求将有所不同。尽管缺乏一个未经处理的群体，但法国案例尚未进行过以前改革方面的研究，但可以找到一些包括法国在内的跨国研究。我们已经提到[?]发现如果考虑了国家趋势，则对就业没有影响。[?]并未研究改革，但通过跨国数据集表明OEcs保护越严格，企业使用临时工应对工作量波动就越多, 这是法国法律变化所说明的结论。葡萄牙方面[?]发现OECs雇佣成本上升会导致FTCs劳动份额增加。其次，在我们的研究中出现了几个以前文献中尚未精确研究过的效应：出现了两种相反效应, 显示了劳动力市场政策的复杂性：FTCs急剧下降，不稳定性减少，而OECs的平均持续时间大大缩短，不稳定性增加。这两种效应都是直观的，但我们对法律变化的研究表明了巨大的效应，尽管我们的结果高估了合同之间替代可能性。虽然长期来看效果会减弱, 但年轻人在OECs中更好地融入, 此外, 如前所述, 总体效果是中立的。最后, 对外生需求变化显示出如果需求上升，则El-Khomri法律似乎有利于降低失业率，并非充分条件。此外，在需求下降时调整也更高。然而，需要更多工作来使我们的模型更可靠。首先，即使只对第30条进行建模，在改革对总需求产生影响方面可能会改变结果。平均而言，由于劳动力过剩被迅速消除和工资降低导致企业利润增加16%。由于OECs持续时间缩短（且生产率较低），平均工资下降9% 。较低的工资对需求有负面影响。利润增加具有依赖于其利用的效果。它们可能意味着更多投资和/或价格下降，从而提高竞争力和国内外需求。因此，需求产生相反的效应，但净效应没有理由为零。我们打算建立一个简单的基于主体的商品和信贷市场模型来嵌入WorkSim。其次，我们正在构建一个包含临时帮助工作岗位的模型扩展，这将允许更精确地评估三种合同之间的替代情况。第三，我们打算研究El-Khomri法律对根据该法律进入劳动力市场并在没有该法律情况下进行职业生涯的工人群体的终身影响, 这是自然实验人工对照组。法律中的其他要素可能会改变其效果。雇主可能会有增加工作时间持续性以降低成本，并且这会降低实施此增加措施企业中就业率. 然而, 工作时间通过薪水、利润和竞争力变化对宏观经济产生复杂影响, 需要上述宏观经济框架. 我们还留待未来研究该法律中另一个元素，即“青年保障”，旨在为他们提供福利补贴和加强就业帮助。对于建模这样的ALP需要更多细节，因为我们的模型可以轻松研究crowding out效应。因此，我们将避免对这个复杂法律做出扁平化的判断，超出了我们实验所揭示的重要后果。
